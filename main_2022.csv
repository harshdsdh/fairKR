Here's an issue that should unite liberals and the left: Trump's fascistic tactics in Portland. Why aren't we talking about this more?,"Many of you already know about this, but for those who don't. Take a look at this timeline of the protests in Portland: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Portland,_Oregon

**June**

* Mostly peaceful, few stories of mild civil unrest
* No request for federal assistance from Mayor Wheeler or Governor Brown
* No constitutional authority for Trump to intervene

**Late June**

Trump issues an executive order to protect statues. Because of course he fucking did. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_deployment_of_federal_forces_in_the_United_States#Founding_of_PACT

This gives him the constitutional excuse he needs to not only assemble a task force of federal agents, but to enter cities where the precious statues might be endangered.

**July**

After the feds get involved, it's just story after story of riots and violence.

**August**

Feds finally pull out, and it immediately gets more peaceful. Not as peaceful as June, unsurprisingly. 

The fucking priorities of this man. In the middle of a pandemic, he issues an executive order to protect statues in order to give himself an excuse to send the federal government into a city against the wishes of the mayor and state governor. He places them directly in the path of the protests, deliberately encouraging conflicts between protesters and the feds. A few kidnappings into unmarked vans later, Trump decided he's collected enough video clips for FOX News and withdraws. Things immediately settle down.

Trump doesn't give a fuck about those statues, but he knows the mouthbreathing conservative culture warriors do. How fucking blatant is that? Everyone on the left and in the center should be outraged by this. Everyone on the right, fuck you.

**edit:**

I think my original post was maybe too focused on the timeline in Oregon, which is important to the story, but not quite as alarming as the executive order protecting statues which is really what makes this whole thing fascist.

Executive Order 13933, Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence, **has been interpreted as allowing federal officers to be deployed without the permission of individual U.S. states.** It's also been used to authorize domestic surveillance.

I don't know how anybody could read about this and not be alarmed. This is without precedent. Don't take it from me, though. [Take it from FOX News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/judge-napolitano-operation-legend-federal-troops-chicago):

>“If the state officials or local officials consent to the introduction of federal assets on the streets and for law enforcement purposes there is no constitutional impediment,” [Judge Napolitano] explained. “But if they don't consent, then there is a constitutional impediment.”

I know we haven't always gotten along, progressives, leftists, liberals, centrists, libertarians, and so on. But please take a long hard look at the base principles of whichever ideology you favor.

I think the vast majority of people who hold those principles should be able to agree on this one thing. Right wingers, you're going to regret this path. Abandon your shit ideology and join the rest of the free world already.

**edit 2:**

The more I think about this, the worse it gets. What that executive order achieves:

1. There is no federal law prohibiting damage to state monuments and statues. There are state laws, but there's no federal law.

2. So the executive order creates a new type of ""forbidden"" behavior that was not forbidden before. Again, it's not a law or a crime at the federal level.

3. It authorizes the creation of a massive federal paramilitary force in order to enforce this new federal prohibition against the forbidden behavior.

4. The force can be deployed into states and cities even against the consent of the state and city government.

5. Destroying statues on state property is already a crime in every state, does that make this less bad? Yes. In a more charitable view, you could say that this is just the federal government enforcing the law on behalf of the state when the state itself refuses to do. Never mind that many cities were actually okay with the statues being destroyed and in many cases even announced that they would take them down themselves.

This will definitely be challenged in the courts, so it may yet be ruled unconstitutional. By the new 6-3 Supreme Court. If they find it constitutional, here's one potential way to state the precedent: ""An executive order can prohibit a behavior and enforce this under threat of violence, even against the will of state and local governments, so long as the prohibited behavior is already illegal in that state.""

This isn't good. One of tactics that city governments use to deal with protests and riots is to basically stop enforcing some petty crimes. Graffiti and minor vandalism particularly, or allowing statues to be destroyed which in many cities actually did a pretty damn good job of calming everyone down.

Now Trump can legally escalate any protest to violence in any American city. No meaningful protest can avoid producing some amount of graffiti, littering, vandalism, noise level laws. He can use it selectively too: aggressive and heavy handed federal involvement at BLM protests, no federal involvement at Proud Boys protests. ""Everyone has been calling these guys 'fascists' but at least they can protest peacefully, unlike the other side.""

This isn't a good path to be heading down.

Fox News and Trump supporters have already decided the New York Times report on Trump's taxes is fake news. Got me thinking....,"A big problem with a lot of remaining Trump supporters is that they're happy enough with their individual lives that they don't see the need for candidates that promote change.

The things that upset them most in their day to day lives are the ""bad"" things they hear about that other people are doing. So they're going to vote for the person they think will stop the ""bad things"".

They are also heavily group focused and do not want to have an opinion that is different from their people. They trust their people and that someone has done the research even if they ""don't have time for that"".

If you had been a part of thier group and you disagree, it's assumed that you're changing groups and becoming brainwashed so your points will be dismissed.

So how do we actually win them over?

I think we have to make them think we're not too different from them whenever possible. And speak only to the things that affect them directly or morally infuriate them.

If they're a one policy voter with abortion- talk to them about how you used to be ""pro life"" too until you read about it and learned that more people are supported in their and their babies lives through the pro choice movement.

If they are worried about their taxes going up and the government being too big, talk about how Trump has not helped in those departments and how Biden's tax plan is actually more favorable for them.

They don't care about our causes. We have to convince them on grounds that matter to them.

Alternative to Court Packing,"1. Eliminate a set number of Justices.\*
2. Have a president nominate a new justice in the first and third year of their term.
3. Establish implied consent from the Senate after six months.
4. Set a term limit of twenty years from when this law is established.
5. Set some minimum qualification requirements for Judges and Justices; Such as rated qualified by the American Bar Association.

It would eliminate the uncertainty of how many justices get nominated by a single president. It would make the court less 'swingy' and more steady. This is a less partisan method of improving the court in the long term. It does not set a precedent of just increasing the number of justices every presidency and does not further entrench the court as a partisan institution.

So what do you guys think?

The more he realizes this the crazier he will get. He is trying to figure out how to loose and still look like a winner. To us that is crazy. To Trump it is the only way he knows how to loose. Which is to claim it wasn't a fair election. He will go the rest of his life claiming the election was stolen from him.

PA Voter Here - I'm Moving Out of State Next Week (Temp). Already on Vote By Mail. How Can I Vote for Biden in Pennsylvania,"Hi all, thanks in advance if you're able to help or send me to a place I can find it

I'm a Pennsylvania registered voter but moving out of state next week. It's a temporary move so I'm still a PA resident and not the state I'm moving to (NY). I'll be there past the election 

I want to make sure I vote for Biden!

I'm already signed up for VBM from the primary. I will be here when early in person voting starts on 9/29, but leaving next day. So VBM ballots are supposed to start going out on 9/29, I will obviously not be here when it gets delivered

How can I still cast this vote?

I know early in person starts on 9/29. But isn't that for voters who haven't requested VBM only? I thought my mail ballot would have just been mailed out by 9/29, so I can't use in person early. I'm not sure, if anyone knows?

Or can I change the address where my VBM is sent? If they can send to my temporary address in NY that's perfect, but I wasn't sure. Anyone know?

Or perhaps request an excuse absentee? But again but sure if my current VBM ballot being sent prevents that.

Thanks if anyone is able to help",1,"pa voter - 'm moving state next week ( temp ) . already vote mail . vote biden pennsylvaniahi , thanks advance 're able help send place find 'm pennsylvania registered voter moving state next week .

Which close Senate races should we donate to?,"Just thought I'd try to get a better feel from you guys on where my donation(s) might be most effective right now.  I'm going by the rule of thumb that it's more effective to give directly to the candidates themselves than say, the DNC for them to use however. I tried to generically search for advise that might give a little bit more of bird's eye view over all the races, but came up short. So if you had say, $100, (I intend to give more, ) how would you spread it strategically over the tighest or most vital races? Of course every race is important, but maybe you have insights or resources into who actually needs the money more right now?

I've used Actblue for Biden a few times, and given a little to Amy McGrath, but recently heard that she may not be able to overtake McConnell, and the money could be better used elsewhere? I also heard that Harrison running against Lindsey actually has plenty of money, and the polls are still tight AF. So I'm just skeptical.

Setup a stand on campus to get people to register?,"Hi everyone!
So I just had a sudden idea and wanted to see if anyone has any suggestions or experience with something like this.

I’m currently enrolled in a community college in rural Kansas. Campus is pretty dead but ppl still are still on campus for class, so I had this idea of setting up a table and setting up a couple laptops that people can stop by to quickly register to vote (our deadline to register is October 13). Hold up a couple signs to call people over and let them know what we’re there for and yeah. 


The thing is that I’m not very involved with my campus or any organizations. I’m assuming I would have to ask some official from the school to be able to do this. I’m not a very social person, in fact I’m pretty shy but I feel very strongly in sticking it to Trump supporters here in this town and getting people to register. Especially since I know that if a lot of us younger people get together we might bare substantial weight in this election.

Any opinions, suggestions? Is this even reasonable or should i leave it alone and let someone else better versed take care of it? How would my school take it if I asked them? 

I was thinking this doesn’t have to be a big deal, but maybe I’m wrong and there’s a lot more to it? After all, I don’t really see any political groups in my town trying to get people to register or anything so maybe there’s a reason for that.",1,"setup stand campus get people register ? hi everyone ! sudden idea wanted see anyone suggestions experience something like . ’ currently enrolled community college rural kansas . campus pretty dead ppl still still campus class , idea setting table setting couple laptops people stop quickly register vote ( deadline register october 13 ) . hold couple signs call people let know ’ yeah . thing ’ involved campus organizations . ’ assuming would ask official school able . ’ social person , fact ’ pretty shy feel strongly sticking trump supporters town getting people register . especially since know lot us younger people get together might bare substantial weight election . opinions , suggestions ? even reasonable leave alone let someone else better versed take care ? would school take asked ? thinking ’ big deal , maybe ’ wrong ’ lot ? , ’ really see political groups town trying get people register anything maybe ’ reason ."

What are your opinions on Puerto Rico becoming a state?,"Hey all. So I’m a Hispanic-American living in Puerto Rico. As of now I am grimly witnessing what was the slow descent of what was left of American Democracy turn into a full blown high-speed train headed to fascism and I can do absolutely diddly squat about it because I don’t have a say when it comes to the presidential election. I can vote for exactly zero senators, and can only vote for a single-non-voting representative in the House (she can only vote in assigned committees). On the other hand, the outcome of the whole election will directly impact what happens over here, negatively or positively. We are 3.1 million Americans in a state of limbo where we are not our own country and therefore cannot trade with other countries, but we also can’t participate in any meaningful way in the laws that Congress approves over us or over the nation as a whole. 


I wanted to ask y’all directly. What are your thoughts on admitting Puerto Rico as a state? 

Before you answer here are some facts:

1. Puerto Rico is about the size of Iowa. It would have 6 electoral votes. 

2. I can see Puerto Rico as a lean D state, having 1-2 Dem Senators and 2-3 Dem representatives, depending on the election year. 

3. Essentially, we lean Democrat, but we could easily go Republican if it’s a wave year and with the right messaging.

DEEP STATE?,"So, I have a question. If Democrats are all part of a ""deep state"" conspiracy, is it the lamest of all overthrows of any government anywhere? Everything the Democrats have done since trump has been in office has been a colossal failure. How can you take over a government with all the following rules and working within the boundaries of the law. 
I mean if you are going to overthrow a government you would need a charismatic leader that could make people believe whatever he wants, you would want to devide the nation and make your followers feel as if there very life is at stake and the other half of the nation wants to subjugate every aspect of there lives. You want to get leaders of your party to fall lock step in behind you. Skirt the law, convince your followers that you are exactly like they are even though it should be obvious that he is nothing like you. Start saying that everything the other party does is in antithesis of what you belive and you need to defend it to save the world. Start saying that if the other party wins it can only be because they cheated and lied. Then you, yourself lie, lie, lie never admit fault or weakness. If some disagrees with you or your agenda start blowing the dog whistles and destroy them. Push, push,push don't stop never pass up an opportunity to denigrate and sow seeds of doubt and discontent. Change the rules to meet your needs. Make small changes that no one would suspect anything until all the rules have been change to benefit you. And finally get help from an enemy state. 
Democrats haven't done any of these things, so I guess we need to get on the ball before the Republicans do....this.....shit!",1,"deep state ? , question . democrats part `` deep state '' conspiracy , lamest overthrows government anywhere ? everything democrats done since trump office colossal failure . take government following rules working within boundaries law . mean going overthrow government would need charismatic leader could make people believe whatever wants , would want devide nation make followers feel life stake half nation wants subjugate every aspect lives . want get leaders party fall lock step behind . skirt law , convince followers exactly like even though obvious nothing like . start saying everything party antithesis belive need defend save world . start saying party wins cheated lied . , lie , lie , lie never admit fault weakness . disagrees agenda start blowing dog whistles destroy . push , push , push n't stop never pass opportunity denigrate sow seeds doubt discontent . change rules meet needs . make small changes one would suspect anything rules change benefit . finally get help enemy state . democrats n't done things , guess need get ball republicans ... .this ... ..shit !"

Donald Underwood?,"Hi,


So I’ve been following the press titles regarding the Supreme Court judges and Trump. I didn’t really understand it really. Tried to read some articles but none of them is “non-US-citizen- friendly”. Can someone explains what happened exactly, and how is that affecting the elections? The reason why I’m asking is that I’m in the final episodes of House of Cards S05 (not gonna see S06) and there are lots of similarities between the psychopaths that are Trump and Francis underwood. 

Their manipulative, anti-social (in the psychological context) personality made it hard for me to ignore the fact the House of Cards is actually predicting what’s gonna happen in the near future.

We need to get rid of Mitch McConnell NOW more than EVER.,"Look, Mitch McConnell was a hindrance to democracy before last week but right now we have a chance to retire him once and for all. I'm a field organizer for Amy McGrath's campaign and we have been talking to Kentuckians all summer and for much longer before that about what they need in their representative. They need someone with integrity who stands up and acknowledges that Kentucky is worth fighting for.

This race has never been closer and we have a real fighting chance but we can't do it without help. In the age of COVID, voting has never been safer or easier but many of our neighbors don't know how to vote. We will be calling Kentuckians every day from now until the election on November 3rd to inform them on how to vote and to tell them what Amy stands for, Amy is counting on us. Making phone calls and having one on one conversations is the most effective way of securing someone's vote and support.

Here below is the link to all of our Phonebank Timeslots coming up (they are in EST). If you have any questions or have any other way you would like to help, please shoot me a private message. Thank you for your time!

"Looking For Veterans to Stand Up, To Remember Their Oath, To Support And Defend",">tl;dr: I'm a combat vet. I watched American citizens and reporters get beaten and gassed illegally. I watched it be done by local police, military, and federal forces. I got pissed off. I started protesting for the first time. Accidentally started a veteran organization. 3 months later we're growing and the need is bigger than ever. My eyes have been opened and I can't unsee the travesty occurring in our country right now. Now we need your help. [Volunteer here.](https://www.continuetoserve.vet/get-involved) [Our website here.](https://www.continuetoserve.vet)

&#x200B;

On June 1st, I watched something I had never personally witnessed. I watched people, citizens, reporters, journalists, photographers, peacefully protesting or doing their jobs reporting the news, be beaten, gassed, and shot with rubber bullets. I had blackhawks hovering over my house and a city I have come to love and call home was flooded with thousands of federal officers and military personnel. It was a small taste of what martial law would be like. And as a combat veteran, as someone who has lost people overseas in what I now believe were useless and unnecessary wars, I did not sign up, deploy, and lose friends, my mental health, my own family upon my return, so that I could watch a President utterly destroy the very fabric our nation was founded on.

On June 2nd, myself and a fellow veteran I deployed with went to BLM Plaza to stand in solidarity with the BLM movement and for the rights of all Americans to protest and exercise their 1A right to free speech. We stood because we believed that the military should never be used on US soil to silence a free people with rights. This is not the America I grew up believing in. So we stood. 

Having never organized before, having never gone to a protest, I had no idea what to do or what to expect. We've now been out there for 3 months. Standing with, supporting local BLM grassroots orgs, and now we are on the brink of establishing our own 501c3 to continue our mission. We are Continue To Serve, a veteran-based nonprofit, focused on social justice issues and community service. We stand for the rights of all citizens and intend to remember our oath to support and defend the Constitution and the citizens it represents. 

I'm not asking for donations. I am asking for something more valuable, we need your time, your energy, your expertise. Veterans, please join us in standing up for what is right and calling out what is wrong. We are a direct action organization, but in time, we are planning on establishing training and education platforms, community service support systems, and we will expand into more than just the BLM Movement and the Vote. There are many issues that need our attention and veterans can no longer sit idle and stay quiet. We must stand. Please join us. No matter where in the country you are, we can use your help.

Roberts, or any of the other conservative judges, can stop that by resigning, denying Moscow Mitch his power grab prize. They know this is blatantly unfair.

Senate candidates to (and to not) donate to,"After the passing of Ruth Bater Ginsburg I'm sure many of us are worried about the future of the Supreme Court, so here's some senate campaigns to throw some money to, and some to not do that with 

**WHO TO NOT DONATE TO**

Amy McGrath of Kentucky 
I loath Mitch McConnell, but if polls are any indication, McGrath can not win, it is not worth it to spend money on this race, it's sad, but the next best thing to replacing McConnell is making him lose control of the senate 

Doug Jones of Alabama 
It pains me to say this, but Jones is losing, there's not anything that can be done about it. Alabama is red as hell and it's just a waste of money. I love Jones and wouldn't trade his last three years representing Alabama for anything, but it was always borrowed time. (I'm hoping he gets picked for Attorney General)

John Hickenlooper of Colorado 
Full stop, Gardner is done, Hickenlooper will win in Colorado no matter what, which is good because it's more money to other senate races

Mark Kelly of Arizona 
Mark Kell is up against McSally, BY DOUBLE DIGITS. Kelly has all the money he needs, this seat is another safe Dem pickup 

**WHO TO SEND MONEY TOO**
Sara Gideon of Maine https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ads-sg-feb?refcode=ads-190701-gs-evergreen_dtd-natl-searchers_brandedkeys-ad1-sara gideon&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2aa_79Sceea4kEwu7sN_8oTI5z4BaMeIKalj1NqFzR33fGDxv6DVWQaAljmEALw_wcB
Susan Collins has to go and Gideon needs all the help she can get. Polls are good but too close for comfort

Cal is in a single digit race against Tillis in what is most likely the tipping point of the senate, we win this, we have the senate thanks to Harris

Gary Peters of Michigan https://secure.actblue.com/donate/peters_ads?refcode=ads_gs_branded_d2d_nat&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2avY2rR9NSEDaD5kqyZxoP37ckSnnH0PKjQRNXgTMrmSUIzcQAN65AaAogqEALw_wcB
We do need to defend seats and the only non-Alabama one I'm worried about is Peters, his opponent has out raised him on past quarters and I'd rather he not win. Please keep my home state blue

Steve Bullock of Montana https://secure.actblue.com/donate/scb-ads-200423-search-dd?refcode=ads_search_200423_steve bullock_ad4_461969414615&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2ZQgUfFPkTDhyM1nSZP15tRPROGduHdEHWceTqSVq_YMS6EBs6snRYaAs0xEALw_wcB
Bullock is our best senate recruitment of this cycle. He is the popular term limited governor of Montana and the only one who can win this seat for dems, please donate.

Joni Ernst is currently one of the peast popular senators and we have a real chance at taking this seat, Greenfield can do it, once again, please donate 

Jon Ossoff of Georgia https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_fr_ossoff_q32019_dd_senateblue_a?refcode=MS_AD_D-DD_2019.09.09_X_GG_KW__X__eyJjcmVhdGl2ZSI6IkZsaXAgR0EgQmx1ZSIsImF1ZGllbmNlIjoiT0ZVU1MifQ&recurring=TRUE&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2bytQ4YXZ_8Wf5uhU6uc1AN3EHQj3-9w6SSKqxE5-9zEqn4D2NwCVMaAjR4EALw_wcB
Remember him? Well after losing a house race he is currently running for senate in the swing stage of Georgia, and he's neck and neck with his opponent. We can win this race!

Rev. Ralph Warnock of Georgia (special) https://secure.actblue.com/donate/wfg_ads-a?amount=25&amounts=25,50,100,250,500,1000,2800&refcode=ads_alw_gs_brand_d2d_nat_tCPA&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2aeoNNmWvK0x6b7ZAWEG3UI4RZBnZyfxA__bgG7z9MkjFpqtDOB2YUaAtgTEALw_wcB
Guess what? Both of Georgia's senate seats are up and the best dem to flip this one is Warnock, who has overtaken Liberman in polls for the top dem in this race. Please donate and pray we don't get locked out of this race.

Jamie Harrison of South Carolina https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_harrison_fr_q12019_jaime-a?refcode=MS_AD_D-DD_2019.03.08_X_GG_KW__X__eyJjcmVhdGl2ZSI6IkpvaW4gSGlzIFRlYW0iLCJhdWRpZW5jZSI6IkhhcnJpc29uRm9yU2VuYXRlIn0&recurring=TRUE&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2YHDld1f-m4HLanjJ3lSr3dS0mzZl4ej5uceRWEZUFP_FSWxR40f04aAjXREALw_wcB
A poll came out that has Harrison TIED with Lindsey Graham! Graham needs to go and Harrison can do it. This is a better investment then Kentucky, please donate 

**WHO TO MAYBE GIVE MONEY TO**

Dr. Al Gross of Alaska 
https://secure.actblue.com/donate/algross-2020-q3search?gpsid=35_111_14220&refcode=gpsGLSad20_200730_srchfr_d2d_gq_ntlinfoskr__&utm_campaign=gpsGLSad20_200730_srchfr_d2d_gq_ntlinfoskr__&utm_medium=ads&utm_source=agros&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2ZEQ-v9Gqz2LLfG_2C4xCw7sN101fY5yoDeKl8RVeV_a8rgW0kpCIsaAswCEALw_wcB
Alaska may be red but it's also very independent and that's who Gross is, and independent with the backing of the democratic party. Polls shows a race with many undecideds but ultimately this is a long shot. If you want to, give the good Doctor some moeny

Dr. Barbara Bollier of Kansas https://bollierforkansas.com
Another doctor and another long shot. While Kobach is unfortunately not her opponent, polls still show a close race. I wish we had more but until then she's not a bad investment 

Mike Espy of Mississippi https://espyforsenate.com
Another long shot but a possible pickup if we're lucky. He came close in the special election in 2018 so here's to hoping he wins.

MJ Hegar of Texas https://mjfortexas.com
Texas is trending blue, and while Cornyn is not as disliked as Cruz, he is also not as well known. Polls aren't the best but there's a possibility here. Fingers crossed

A simple truth: Republicans Must Cheat,"It’s a simple truth: Republicans can’t win if they don’t cheat 

The past two rep presidents didn’t win the popular vote. George bush won when Florida (run by his brother Jeb) said they miscounted the votes and it was too close to call. Then W (from an oil family) sent America to war with a country based on the lie that they had weapons of mass destrucion. Iraq never did.  They had oil which we annexed and they had death for thousands of Americans. Bush lied. Got what he wanted and thousands died. 

Donald also didn’t win the popular vote. He won when Russia interfered in the election and got him the win. This, in addition to years of gerrymandering districts to benefit republican outcomes and making it virtually impossible for low income citizens to vote in republican urban areas got him the win. Now he has assigned one of his largest financial donors to run the post office to manage mail in ballots. For the epidemic, Donald  admitted he lied to the American people that it was not so bad. He lied and hundreds of Thousands more Americans died. 

The republican head of the senate blocked the assignment of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee for a whole year saying it was too close to an election to vote. And now with less than two months to an election he is trying to force one in. Cheating. They make third grader excuses and say everyone does it and keep doing it. They ignore congressional subpoenas because they know they would be convicted. They suppress and attack scientific facts because they know their extremist beliefs are wrong. Cheating. 
The Republican Party can not win anything on a fair playing field so they cheat. Consistently. Year after year so they can get what they want at the expense of the rest of the country. 

They are so far from American Law and freedom they make the Taliban look like missionaries.

Hope in the midst of darkness,"Fellow Democrats,

Be brave!

We are facing the greatest challenge since World War II, we stand in the midst of darkness. The pandemic is taking countless lives due to the greatest dereliction of duty by a President in the history of America and those who follow him. The economic consequences will be felt for years to come as will the grief for every American lost. There will be a need to care for those who will have suffered permanent damage to their lungs and hearts. Not to mention the psychological trauma this period will have caused on thousands of Americans. Children all across America will need all the support we can give them to get them back on track in school, young adults will need support to get their careers back on track. All this as we must, absolutely must, tackle the crisis of global warming head on.

Be full of Hope!

I am full of hope, even as we stand in the midst of darkness, while the Republicans are clawing their hooks into the Supreme Court, and the pandemic rages on, I am full of hope. 

I am hopefull because people all across America have had it. They've had it with draconian Republican policies that no longer are tolerable. The republican party has been leaning on anti abortion, anti health care, anti financial aid, anti LGBTG  rights, anti climate and anti truth for too long and people have had it. People have had it with republican cronyism and self dealing. People have had it with the President and the Senate who serve themselves and wall street over the stakeholders of this nation.

Work arduously!

We are ahead in crucial senate races, in particular in Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado. When we win those races we take the senate. Recent polling shows we are competitive in Alaska, Montana, Kansas, Texas, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina. Let's us get right on it because America deserves better, America wants better.

This is the election were we beat back the darkness, this is the election were we retake the senate, the presidency and keep the house and get this nation back on track. 

Sleep sound at night knowing that there is hope in the midst of darkness and wake to work for the change America needs.",1,"hope midst darknessfellow democrats , brave ! facing greatest challenge since world war ii , stand midst darkness . pandemic taking countless lives due greatest dereliction duty president history america follow . economic consequences felt years come grief every american lost . need care suffered permanent damage lungs hearts . mention psychological trauma period caused thousands americans . children across america need support give get back track school , young adults need support get careers back track . must , absolutely must , tackle crisis global warming head . full hope ! full hope , even stand midst darkness , republicans clawing hooks supreme court , pandemic rages , full hope . hopefull people across america .

Democrat Agenda for first 100 days,"There is no doubt that the Republicans have been re-writing rules to allow them to maintain their minority rule (evidence in stacking federal judges after refusing hearings with Obama, stealing the Garland seat and then reversing with RBG). Here are my thoughts on what the democrat administration needs to do to restore democracy. This assumes Biden wins and we take back at least 50 seats in the Senate.

1. Get rid of the filibuster. Republicans aren't interested in norms or rules and the dems should stop playing by the old rules. In order to restore order to the republic with reform, this rule needs to go.
2. Term limits on Supreme Court judges. I know a lot of folks talk about packing the court, but the challenge is the death spiral this creates. When republicans get power back they'd just do the same, so we'd go from 9 to 11 to 13 and so on. Term limits could accomplish the same goal. If set at 16 years, effective immediately, it would boot Thomas, Robert and Altito- along with Breyer. This would give the dems a 5-4 advantage in the first term. 
3. Statehood for DC and consider splitting California into two states. Red states have way too much power overall, relative to population. The only way to level this playing field is to add to the field. By adding 2 - 4 safe democratic seats, the senate will be more reflective of the US population.
4. Get rid of the electoral college. Small population center states votes count more than dense states. The electoral college is the only reason republicans have won in the recent past. Every vote should be equal in the presidential election.
5. New voter rights laws, including federal rules restricting Gerrymandering. Clearly the dems need to restore voter rights that the Supreme Court knocked down. But, in addition, we have to stop the blatant gerrymandering. I'm not sure the answer, but the crazy shapes to ensure a democrat or republican victory have to go. Gerrymandering allows for more 'safe' districts where a party can run an extreme candidate and win. This encourages more and more extreme candidates that aren't beholden to the people because they can't be voted out. Get rid of this and we can reduce extreme politics (and maybe, just maybe the parties will start working together occasionally).
6. New laws on the media to make them accountable for their reporting. Opinion shows rule the cable news network and Fox has no journalist integrity. Hannity will report on conspiracy theories like they are fact and then does not retract when they are proven false. There has to be penalties for spreading false information without equal time retracting the information (on the same show). This should extent to FB, BTW.

&#x200B;

Once you have all of this done, the democrats need to move fast on health care, tax reform and corruption laws. But without the above done, we'll be hanging from fingertips every 2-4 years.  Government needs to work for the people, not the few, special interests and the rich.

The Mississippi Senate might just be competitive,"The Mississippi Senate might just be competitive according to this latest poll. The Republican Incumbent (Cindy Hyde-Smith) is up by only 1 point. Looking at the polling, there is an obvious trend which can be seen. Mike Espy is gaining ground. Around May, the margin was 28 points, but since then, all polls indicate that the race is tightening up and is now within reach.

I know the likelihood of Mike Espy winning in Mississippi are low, even with the polls and all. But this just shows how a Blue wave is coming to drown Moscow Mitch and his henchmen.

Are Trump campaign fundraising emails and texts illegal?,"**TL:DR**

My understanding is that fundraising practices for political campaigns are pretty heavily regulated. So my question is: is the Trump campaign using illegal practices, and if so, why is no one taking it to court?

**Details**

I thought it would be interesting to sign up for Trump emails and texts. Interesting it was, but also kinda scary. And more specifically, full of lies and deception. Beyond being angry about this (somehow it really boiled my blood that he's taking advantage of his own supporters), it really seems like it should be illegal to lie in your campaign fundraising. I'm especially interested in verifying these ""700% match"" claims. Here are a few specific example snippets (with real name redacted):

Texts:

There Isn’t Much Reason to Believe a Supreme Court Opening Will Help the Trump Campaign, ,1,’ much reason believe supreme court opening help trump campaign
Hmmmm I wonder what they’ll do now though,"Not that they actually care. 

“2016, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait to the next election.”

2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): “I don’t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.”

2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): “The very balance of our nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.”

2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice.” 

2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): “The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.”

2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): “In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.” 

2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.”

2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.”

2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): “I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.”

2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): “I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.””",1,"hmmmm wonder ’ thoughnot actually care . “ 2016 , sen. ted cruz ( r-texas ) : “ 80 years since supreme court vacancy nominated confirmed election year . long tradition ’ election year. ” 2018 , sen. lindsey graham ( r-s.c. ) : “ opening comes last year president trump ’ term , primary process started , ’ wait next election. ” 2016 , sen. marco rubio ( r-fla. ) : “ ’ think moving nominee last year president ’ term - would say republican president. ” 2016 , sen. david perdue ( r-ga. ) : “ balance nation ’ highest court serious jeopardy . member senate judiciary committee , everything power encourage president senate leadership start process hear american people. ” 2016 , sen. chuck grassley ( r-iowa ) : “ lifetime appointment could dramatically impact individual freedoms change direction court least generation important get bogged politics . american people ’ denied voice. ” 2016 , sen. thom tillis ( r-n.c. ) : “ campaign already way . essential institution senate health republic launch nation partisan , divisive confirmation battle time american people casting ballots elect next president. ” 2016 , sen. richard burr ( r-n.c. ) : “ election year , american people opportunity say future direction country . reason , believe vacancy left open justice antonin scalia filled new president. ” 2016 , sen. roy blunt ( r-mo . ) : “ senate confirm new supreme court justice new president. ” 2016 , sen. cory gardner ( r-col. ) : “ think ’ close election . president elected november one makes decision. ” 2016 , sen. rob portman ( r-ohio ) : “ believe best thing country trust american people weigh make lifetime appointment could reshape supreme court generations . ’ unusual . common practice senate stop acting lifetime appointments last year presidential term , ’ nearly 80 years since president permitted immediately fill vacancy arose presidential election year. ” 2016 , sen. ron johnson ( r-wisc . ) : “ strongly agree american people decide future direction supreme court votes president majority party u.s. senate . ” ”"

"Could a Democratic House and Senate (with some help) impeach and convict Trump between Jan 3 and Jan 20, 2021?","I don't think this is a likely scenario. But is it possible? Nothing about the next few months is going to be typical, all kinds of shenanigans may happen. Many Democrats in power appear to have realized that restricting their strategies to any honored conventions other than the actual law and Constitution puts them at disadvantage to aggressive Republican tactics.

Winners of the November 2020 election will be sworn in on these dates:

New senators are sworn in Jan 3, 2021.

Source: [Wikipedia - 2020 US Senate elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_Senate_elections)

New representatives sessions also start Jan 3.

Source: [Wikipedia - US House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives)

BUT, any new president would not be inaugurated, until January 20, 2021.

Source: [Wikipedia - US Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election)

ERGO: From January 3, 2021 until January 20, 2021, there would be a window of time where a Democratic majority in the House and Senate could both impeach President Trump - even if Trump was a lame duck president.

Granted a Senate conviction even with a Democratic majority would be difficult, given the need for 2/3 votes to convict. But as the majority, Democrats would have new power to highlight Trump's impeached behavior and pressure or persuade Republican's to help.

Last note: If Trump were convicted in January by the Senate, but had won the election, his ability to take up office on January 20, 2021 would still depend on a separate vote by the Senate on whether to prevent him from ever being able to hold office again. That would seem certain after a conviction given a Democratic majority and this quote from the source below:

Feasibility of gaining Senate seats via coordinated liberal conquest of Wyoming,"I was thinking about the rural/urban Dem/Rep divide and the the news that Bloomberg would front $100M to win Florida when I had this idea. Hear me out!

A Dem-leaning billionaire/highly-funded organization makes a proposal: If you are a Democrat-leaning person living in a urban state interested in securing more blue seats in the Senate this organization will subsidize to some degree your relocation to Wyoming, a very red state with a 2020 population of 578K people

Some issues I expect with this are:

* finding enough liberals willing and able to move from a blue state to Wyoming
* the cost involved in subsidizing the massive migration

Suppose these were not problems. Would this work? 

This is a little tongue-in-cheek but a little serious. I'm interested to hear what other people think or if anybody else has written about this.

This Is What Republicans Previously Said About Appointing SCOTUS Justices During An Election Year,"**Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO):** “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.” 

**Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC):** “In this election year, the  American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the  future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy  left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a  new president.” 

**Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX):**  “I believe the American people deserve to have a voice in the  selection of the next Supreme Court Justice, and the best way to ensure  that happens is to have the Senate consider a nomination made by the  next President.

Confirming a new Supreme Court Justice during a presidential election  year for a vacancy arising that same year is not common in our nation’s  history; the last time it happened was in 1932. And it has been almost  130 years since a presidential election year nominee was confirmed for a  vacancy arising the same year under divided government as we have  today.""

**Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX):** “It has been 80 years since a  Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year.  There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

**Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA):** “We will see what the people say this fall and our next president, regardless of party, will be making that nomination.” 

**Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO):** “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision."" 

**Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC):** “If an opening comes in  the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has  started, we’ll wait to the next election” 

**Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA):** “A lifetime appointment  that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the  direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get  bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a  voice.” 

**Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND):** “There is 80 years of  precedent for not nominating and confirming a new justice of the Supreme  Court in the final year of a president’s term so that people can have a  say in this very important decision.” 

**Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK):** “It makes the current  presidential election all that more important as not only are the next  four years in play, but an entire generation of Americans will be  impacted by the balance of the court and its rulings. Sens. Barack  Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid have all  made statements that the Senate does not have to confirm presidential  nominations in an election year. I will oppose this nomination as I  firmly believe we must let the people decide the Supreme Court’s  future.” 

**Sen. David Perdue (R-GA):** “The very balance of our  nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the  president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear  from the American people.” 

**Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH):** “I believe the best thing  for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who  should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court  for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the  Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a  presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president  was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential  election year.” 

**Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL):** “I don’t think we should be  moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term — I would  say that if it was a Republican president .” 

**Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC):** “Vice President Biden’s  remarks may have been voiced in 1992, but they are entirely applicable  to 2016. The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the  institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not  launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during  the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to  elect our next president.” 

**Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA):** “The next Court appointment should be made by the newly-elected president.”

"The best way to immediately continue RBG’s fight is by donating to Mark Kelly, regardless of what state you live in, as he can be sworn in on November 30th as it is a special election.","I believe Dems have enough procedural powers to slow down the process until after the election. If Trump loses and Republicans lose the senate, ole Moscow Mitch will still try to jam a nomination down America’s throat. Judicial nominees(all appointed positions) has been Mitchy’s game for over a decade.

Mark Kelly is currently favored by 538’s model 78/22. This election by far is a Dems best chance of unseating a Republican. Right now Dems need 4 Republicans to break rank to defeat the Republican senate. If Mark wins, Dems only need 3. It looks like Republican senators in Maine and Alaska will not vote with their party before the election or after if Biden wins. It’s likely that Dems could pick up 1 more if Biden wins.

Further, he is the wife of Rep. Gabby Gifford who was shot while in office, a combat pilot, and an astronaut. Decent resume if I do say so. Plus, he would fill the seat of late Sen. McCain who we all saw do the right thing with his vote to repeal Obamacare.

Obviously this all hinges on Biden winning, but it’s the easiest thing we can do right now while on Reddit before we can formulate a full strategy now that the election has changed. 

Finally, donate to all Dems that you believe in or that we need. This is a suggestion if you have limited funds and you want to get the best bang for your buck. 

Disclaimer: I live in WA and I do not work for nor am I affiliated with the Kelly campaign. I love political strategy and the law. I graduated with a Poli Sci degree and then went on to law school and passed the bar exam.

A Catalog of Hypocrisy,"2016, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait to the next election.”

2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): “I don’t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.”

2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): “The very balance of our nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.”

2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice.” 

2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): “The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.”

2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): “In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.” 

2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.”

2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.”

2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): “I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.”

2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): “I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.”

2016, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky)

Increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court to reverse GOP court packing and how to message about it,"Everyone needs to start recognizing and talking about the fact that the GOP has been packing the courts, including the Supreme Court, for the past 10 years.

If the Democrats win the Presidency and Senate in November there will be a big push from the base to abandon the filibuster and increase the number of seat on the Supreme Court to pack it with left wing judges. This was already talked about before RBG died, and will be absolutely necessary if Trump and McConnell fill her seat. Obama talked about dropping the filibuster during his speech at John Lewis's funeral. The idea isn't new.

What we need to start doing NOW is preparing the ground rhetorically for increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court. The media, the GOP, and politically non-engaged people will decry this at cheating, and court packing. We need to start preparing to counter this argument.

The fact is that the GOP has been court packing ever since 2012. If increasing the number of seats on a court and filling them with like minded judges is court packing, then so is preventing existing seats from being filled under the Constitutionally proscribed process because the person filling them would appoint judges you don't like until a like minded President is elected to fill those seats.

Mitch McConnell packed the Supreme Court when he prevented Obama from naming a replacement for Scalia's seat. He packed the lower courts when he spent 6 years blocking judicial appointments. The past decade of GOP control of the Senate has seen the most egregious court packing in US history. Democrats increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court and lower courts isn't court packing, it's reversing the court packing the GOP has been practicing for a decade.

Everyone should write their Democratic Senators and Senate candidates and express this view. Don't ask them to pack the Supreme Court. Ask them to increase the seats to reverse the court packing the GOP has gotten away with. Frame it like this every single time you talk about it.",1,"increasing number seats supreme court reverse gop court packing message iteveryone needs start recognizing talking fact gop packing courts , including supreme court , past 10 years . democrats win presidency senate november big push base abandon filibuster increase number seat supreme court pack left wing judges . already talked rbg died , absolutely necessary trump mcconnell fill seat . obama talked dropping filibuster speech john lewis 's funeral . idea n't new . need start preparing ground rhetorically increasing number seats supreme court . media , gop , politically non-engaged people decry cheating , court packing . need start preparing counter argument . fact gop court packing ever since 2012. increasing number seats court filling like minded judges court packing , preventing existing seats filled constitutionally proscribed process person filling would appoint judges n't like like minded president elected fill seats . mitch mcconnell packed supreme court prevented obama naming replacement scalia 's seat . packed lower courts spent 6 years blocking judicial appointments . past decade gop control senate seen egregious court packing us history . democrats increasing number seats supreme court lower courts n't court packing , 's reversing court packing gop practicing decade . everyone write democratic senators senate candidates express view . n't ask pack supreme court . ask increase seats reverse court packing gop gotten away . frame like every single time talk ."

The AvengeHer Plan,"(First, abolish the filibuster.)

1. The lower circuit courts of appeals have a wild disparity in number of judges in relation to population. The 11th circuit has one judge for every 2.7 million people while the 10th circuit has one judge for every 1.4 million. This should be made uniform, 1 judge for every million people in a circuit, with a circuit capped at 21 judges with a minimum of 11. Every ten years after the census the courts should be expanded to account for population growth.
2. That means that there should be approximately 332 appeals court judges not 179. This should be spread over 16 circuit courts not 12 plus the Federal and DC Circuit courts which should be brought up to the maximum of 21 judges. This means we need to confirm 172 new appeals court judges to bring population balance to the appeals courts.
3. The Supreme Court use to have a judge to account for each circuit court. Today each Supreme Court Justices is assigned a circuit court to cover with some having to cover multiple courts. This is an unreasonable burden to place on the justices so the court should be expanded so there is one Supreme Court justice for every circuit court.
4. That means there should be 18 Supreme Court Justices and we'll need to confirm an additional 9 justices to meet the requirements of the new law. Every ten years after the census a Supreme Court member will be added to account for any growth in the circuit courts.

We will be establishing some much needed equal representation to the circuit courts and returning the Supreme Court to its traditional role of representing the size of the circuit courts. It's a reasonable plan based on tradition and equality of representation.

"RBG’s passing, upcoming election, and possible reddit election fund for democrats?","Hey guys, 

I’m a 22 year old from Columbus Ohio, I’ve been a democrat my entire life (basically since I understood basic civics education and economics, my family also leans left), I fall between moderate and progressive. With Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s untimely and disappointing passing and upcoming election, I was wondering if we can make an election fund in order to support the democrats who are running for congress, senate, local elections and etc. In particular, this fund can help support those who are in critical/close-call races. Another republican pick to the supreme court maybe disastrous to this country in the long term, there needs to be a balance in the highest court of the land, and hopefully some republicans follow their set principles from 2016 and block a new nominee appointment before the 2021 inauguration. Now more than ever, we need leaders who have a progressive mindset and want to create honest change and can push our country to further heights, this fund should allow that to take place.

Please let me know if this is a good idea, if you guys are interested, and if the moderators are also interested.

Is there anyway we can do this, or does this already exist? I was hoping maybe the Moderators can take a look and maybe create some sort of fund for us to donate to!

"Congratulations to MN, VA, SD and WY! Starting today you get to vote out Trump!","---
#VOTE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE
---
####Mail-In Voting aka Absentee Voting

As of today, MN, VA, SD and WY join PA in beginning early voting to defeat the most dangerous President in history. Make no mistake, this is the most important election of our lives. Nearly all states have expanded mail-in voting eligibility to all citizens, with most states automatically mailing ballots or ballot applications to everyone. If you have not received one, [request your absentee ballot now.](https://www.vote.org/) Nearly all states have waved any requirements for witness/notary for mail-in ballots this election, **however MO has not!** If you live in MO, make a plan now on how to safely vote. (If you know of any other states that have restrictions on voting, please share details in the comments.)

####In-Person Voting

Early voting has begun! Most states are strongly discouraging in-person voting this election due to the pandemic. Check your local state's websites to see if in-person early voting is still available, as many states have switched to mail-in ballot drop-off only. If you choose to vote in-person, first check your voter registration, polling place and any other voting requirements in your state such as an ID. [Currently, most states can request and some require a form of ID to vote in-person.](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx)

####Register to Vote

Voter registration is still open for all 50 states. The first states begin closing voter registration starting Oct 4th, so don't wait! If you haven't yet, now is the time to register, and get your friends and family registered too: https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/

####Election Protection

If you experience harassment, intimidation, or anyone trying to prevent you from voting, report it to Election Protection Hotline (866-687-8683) immediately. No matter what, under federal law you always have the right to cast a provisional ballot, so there is no reason not to try and vote. Make sure you're at the right polling location: in 27 states, if you cast a provisional ballot at the wrong polling location, your vote will not be counted.

"Democrats = make some noise! Stop turning other cheek and ""taking the high road""","""Now is the time to rise up"" may sound cliche - but it fits. I encourage fellow Democrats make their voices heard loud and clear going into this final run to the election.

First, I'd like to see *much* more of Biden giving performances like last night town hall. He needs to be everywhere. So does Harris. Trump clearly has an unfair advantage of consistent exposure. We need to do everything we can to help match that.

What can you do?

* DONATE to Biden/Harris or your local fav. ANY amount is welcome.
* PUT UP THE SIGN in your yard and the sticker on your car.
* CORRECT MISINFORMATION / false statements in conversations (but check your emotions).
* Get other Dems to register and VOTE.
* Don't be afraid to SPEAK THE TRUTH on social media (and make sure it is the truth).
* VOLUNTEER any time you can to the candidate of your choice.

The Republican Party - or what's left of it - is a loud and misguided organism. It's time we made the noise of truth to match.

I was just push-polled from Pennsylvania,"I was just push-polled from Pennsylvania.  Even though I live in Seattle I still have the same Pittsburgh cell number I've owned for 20 years.  Some highlights of the call:

* Cold call from a Pittsburgh Area code (412)
* Caller spoke perfect English but had an Indian accent. He was extremely polite and spoke loudly and slowly
* Asked for me by firstname, middlename, lastname  Only about 4 people on Earth know my middle name.  I wonder if this gives insight into how they got my info. 

I told him that I was no longer available at this number but that I love surveys and would gladly take one. 

* He asked me some basic questions regarding if I am registered and if I plan to vote in 2020
* Asked if I was ""locked in"" to my choice or if I could have my mind changed
* Asked how locked in I felt I was

(He very specifically used the word ""party"" for everyone but Trump)

* Asked who I was thinking of voting for.  List of candidates went Dario Hunter, Green Party; Joe Biden, Democratic Party; Donald J Trump, Republican; Jo Jorgensen, Libertarian party

* Favorability of Biden
* Favorability of Trump
* Favorability of Pelosi
* Policy details on a favorability scale. A typical kind of question would be

> Very favorable, Somewhat favorable, Neutral, Somewhat unfavorable, very unfavorable: Instituting a tax plan that would raise taxes on every American while damaging the economy and harming small business

* Questions were primarily economic focused
* Opinion on the favorability scale of ""Hunter Biden and the Biden family using lobbying money and Russian bribes to enrich themselves at the expense of the American people.""

* Opinion on favorability scale of Donald Trumps performance as president
* Opinion on direction of the country
* Opinion on direction of the economy
* Opinion on Trumps economy performance
* Opinion on Trumps security performance
* Opinion on Trumps wildfire performance
* Opinion on Trumps Coronavirus performance
* Which candidate would do better on Defense, which on economy, which on Coronavirus, which on environment, which on corruption

(I thought this next one was strange)

* If you had to choose between two candidates, A and B, where A was a nice guy who means well but was an ineffective lifetime politician, leader of a corrupt family and in bed with a liberal agenda and B was not the nicest person but always had the best interests of the American people at heart and could project strength while keeping the economy strong, which would you pick?

* Favorability of different tax policy propositions. The propositions basically involved ""A a tax plan that would [do very bad sounding things]"" (for stuff that was obviously Biden or ""This proposal that would [do very nice sounding things] "" (for stuff that was obviously Trump)

* Would you vote for a candidate who was going to attack social security and healthcare benefits, and enact policies that would put many Americans over 75 on the street, including those making less than $30K a year

* Once again, who are you planning to vote for in November.
* How certain are you about that vote
* Demographic data - since I told him I wasn't me he took my full name, age bracket, income bracket, urban/suburban/rural, ethnicity, marital status
* Who did you vote for in 2016

TBH I'm not sure how anyone falls for these.

Edit: I have been getting hammered with solicitations from both parties.  Democratic stuff is usually a text message asking me to vote. They usually come in at supremely annoying times about 4-5am for me.  Republican stuff is through the phone mainly but rarely through text.  Phone stuff are polls.  I get polled about 2x weekly now.  I get a text usually during primetime for sports. The texts are almost always guilt trippy. 

I was registered dem from 2004-2016, switched to independent after 2016 primary.  If anyone on the Biden campaign is interested reads this sub, I get a lot of these and I could record them for you.

Edit 2: I almost wonder if this was a low key GOTV call for wavering 2016 Trump voters. I'm shocked they mentioned Hunter Biden when the Trump clan is corrupt to its nepotistic core. I was also surprised they didn't bring out the Supreme Court arguments.

Is there a Democrat/Leftist version of this??? This is literally so ridiculous.,"""GASLIGHTING  
===========  
The term originates in the systematic psychological manipulation of a victim by her husband in Patrick Hamilton’s 1938 stage play Gas Light, and the film adaptations released in 1940 and 1944. In the story, the husband attempts to convince his wife and others that she is insane by manipulating small elements of their environment and insisting that she is mistaken, remembering things incorrectly, or delusional when she points out these changes. The play's title alludes to how the abusive husband slowly dims the gas lights in their home, while pretending nothing has changed, in an effort to make his wife doubt her own perceptions. The wife repeatedly asks her husband to confirm her perceptions about the dimming lights, but in defiance of reality, he keeps insisting that the lights are the same and instead it is she who is going insane.  


We are living in a perpetual state of gaslighting. The reality that we are being told by the media is at complete odds with what we are seeing with our own two eyes. And when we question the false reality that we are being presented, or we claim that what we see is that actual reality, we are vilified as racist or bigots or just plain crazy. You’re not racist. You’re not crazy. You’re being gaslighted.  


New York State has twice as many deaths from Covid-19 than any other state, and New York has accounted for one fifth of all Covid-19 deaths, but we are told that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has handled the pandemic better than any other governor. But if we support policies of Governors whose states had only a fraction of the infections and deaths as New York, we’re called anti-science and want people to die. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


We see mobs of people looting stores, smashing windows, setting cars on fire and burning down buildings, but we are told that these demonstrations are peaceful protests. And when we call this destruction of our cities, riots, we are called racists. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


We see the major problem destroying many inner-cities is crime; murder, gang violence, drug dealing, drive-by shootings, armed robbery, but we are told that it is not crime, but the police that are the problem in the inner-cities. We are told we must defund the police and remove law enforcement from crime-riddled cities to make them safer. But if we advocate for more policing in cities overrun by crime, we are accused of being white supremacists and racists. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


The United States of America accepts more immigrants than any other country in the world. The vast majority of the immigrants are “people of color”, and these immigrants are enjoying freedom and economic opportunity not available to them in their country of origin, but we are told that the United States is the most racist and oppressive country on the planet, and if we disagree, we are called racist and xenophobic. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Capitalist countries are the most prosperous countries in the world The standard of living is the highest in capitalist countries. We see more poor people move up the economic ladder to the middle and even the wealthy class through their effort and ability in capitalist countries than any other economic system in the world, but we are told capitalism is an oppressive system designed to keep people down. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Communist countries killed over 100 million people in the 20th century. Communist countries strip their citizens of basic human rights, dictate every aspect of their lives, treat their citizens like slaves, and drive their economies into the ground, but we are told that Communism is the fairest, most equitable, freest and most prosperous economic system in the world. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


The most egregious example of gaslighting is the concept of “white fragility”. You spend your life trying to be a good person, trying to treat people fairly and with respect. You disavow racism and bigotry in all its forms. You judge people solely on the content of their character and not by the color of their skin. You don’t discriminate based on race or ethnicity. But you are told you are a racist, not because of something you did or said, but solely because of the color of your skin. You know instinctively that charging someone with racism because of their skin color is itself racist. You know that you are not racist, so you defend yourself and your character, but you are told that your defense of yourself is proof of your racism. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Gaslighting has become one of the most pervasive and destructive tactics in American politics. It is the exact opposite of what our political system was meant to be. It deals in lies and psychological coercion, and not the truth and intellectual discourse. If you ever ask yourself if you’re crazy, you are not. Crazy people aren’t sane enough to ask themselves if they’re crazy. So, trust yourself, believe what’s in your heart. Trust your eyes over what you are told. Never listen to the people who tell you that you are crazy, because you are not, you’re being gaslighted.

What a Democratic House Leadership could look like in 2021,"This is an interesting situation. Speaker Pelosi has held her speakership for 3 terms now. To become the 52nd speaker to pledged to limit herself. So she might not become speaker, but if she wants it, she’ll probably get it. But with Assistant Speaker Lujan most likely becoming Senator for New Mexico, and the growing calls for a change in Democratic House Leadership.

(Sidebar: The current top 3 for the democrats in the house are all over 80, but they all won’t leave at the same time. So I believe from the 117th Congress there’ll be changes)

Let’s all be honest here, the democrats will maintain control of the house. Whether they win the Senate or the Presidency is to be determined. Nonetheless, the top 5 will change. Whether Biden wins or not (I believe he will), Rep. Richmond, currently assistant to the Majority Whip, will become the majority whip, even more so if Biden wins as his influence will exponentially rise in Washington. Rep. Jeffries will move from Caucus Chair and Rep. Clark (currently Vice-Chair) will most likely take over. Rep. Jeffries might move to Majority Leader, with Rep. Hoyer (currently Majority Leader) to Speaker. Rep. Bustos (currently DCCC Chair), might move to Assistant Speaker or they’ll have a more progressive here.

But I suspect 117th House Democratic Leadership will look like:

Speaker of the House - Rep. Steyn Hoyer

Majority Leader - Rep. Hakeem Jeffries

Majority Whip - Rep. Cedric Richmond

Assistant Speaker - Rep. Cheri Bustos

Caucus Chair - Rep. Katherine Clark


W.r.t. Rep. Schiff, he’ll remain HPSCI Chair or become DNI if Biden wins. There’s also talk he might run for Senate as Sen. Feinstein would most likely not run for re-election. But that’s going to be a crowded field, from Gov. Newsome to CA Sec of State Padilla to CA AG Beccera, maybe even the Lt. Gov. Kounalakis. As I do think, under the presumption of Biden/Harris winning, Rep. Bass would take Harris’ seat or at least a minority female will be replacing her.

The other progressives in the Democratic Caucus are young and need some years in the House before they move into leadership. I give them 2/3 terms before their moves into House Leadership.

With Rep. Pelosi and Rep. Clyburn out, I still believe they’ll be advising the new house leaders in their roles to help them along the way until they retire from the house, which would be within the next 4 years.",1,"democratic house leadership could look like 2021this interesting situation . speaker pelosi held speakership 3 terms . become 52nd speaker pledged limit . might become speaker , wants , ’ probably get . assistant speaker lujan likely becoming senator new mexico , growing calls change democratic house leadership .

"Today on Senator McCain's funeral,only one living president is not invited : Donald Trump. Till this day he didn't apologize to McCain's family or the POWs for trashing all those members in uniform who were captured and tortured by our enemies.","In an Op-Ed in today's NYT ""Straining to Keep Faith with America"" Bret Stephens has trashed Trump in no uncertain terms by adding this in his piece ""John McCain knew that we are better than Trump.""

To that I like to add my own thoughts saying that maybe, I emphasize the word ""maybe"" again to say that maybe a healthy Senator McCain could put a stop to a marauding president called Trump. 

But with the Republican Senator John McCain's death, there is nothing that can stop Trump from destroying each and every American values that this country developed over two centuries plus more.

Even a Republican president Ronald Reagan's description of America was much different from Trump's vision.

By quoting a phrase from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Reagan declared that our country is like ""a shining city on a hill"".

But since Trump took over the presidency, every Americans are ""straining to keep Faith with America"", the country they love dearly unlike Trump and his followers who only think of what they can get. 

Even Democratic president John Kennedy's words on his inauguration on January 20th, 1961, ""Ask not what your country can do for you_ask what can do for your country"", have no sway over the minds of these fake ""swamp cleaners"" like Trump. 

Trump is more interested in finding how much money he can milk from his presidency than giving some of his assets to the countrymen who were really struggling everyday to keep their faith on America.

Their struggles to keep faith on our institutions are four hundred times more now than before Trump took office on Jan 20th, '17.

That is the reason why we've to feel sorry for John McCain's permanent absence from an institution, mainly the Senate where he grilled each and every Trump's appointees and his cabinet members to hit hard at Trump's illogical policies.

Trump on the other hand didn't have the decency to go to McCain before his death or to his wife and families now to apologize saying, ""I should've never said that I don't care for people like you who got captured at war. As you know I didn't go to Vietnam for my bad foot. But I really appreciate your pains and sufferings due to terrible tortures at the hands of the Vietcong guerrillas. I'm really sorry that you endured those tortures for five plus years just to keep our country safe. May God bless your soul.""

Pragmatism is the name of the game when it comes to the GE; not nit-picky purity tests. Otherwise, staying home, or write-ins, or other forms of protesting the winner of the Dem primary because he/she was not your first choice just ensures another 4 years of Trump. 

There are 20 people running who I'd personally like to see occupy the the WH over its current inhabitant. We can't win the race when we're so set on fighting amongst ourselves.",1,"gentle reminder democratic votersthere 20 dems running primary . means 19 *will* lose . early , late ; put good fight , others much . sure , one may chosen vp candidate , understand , chances first choice guy/gal race likely lose . pragmatism name game comes ge ; nit-picky purity tests . otherwise , staying home , write-ins , forms protesting winner dem primary he/she first choice ensures another 4 years trump . 20 people running 'd personally like see occupy wh current inhabitant . ca n't win race 're set fighting amongst ."

"Please help fellow Democrats, first time voter here having trouble registering to vote in my state! Which I need to do ASAP to vote!!!!","I am a SC resident with a valid drivers license. After finding out that I was actually still registered to vote in NC - where my absentee voter ballot was sent to- I went online today to attempt to register in my current state of SC so that I can actually vote.  Given my license number and social security number, the website located my DMV resident address in SC and it was correct. It then asks previous registration state (NC), and previous registration county (Mecklenburg). The next prompt is where it has lost me. 

The website lists in clear, capital red letters “DO NOT ENTER YOUR RESIDENCE ADDRESS AS YOUR MAILING ADDRESS”. What on earth would I list, if not my resident address? I don’t think I can use my parents home as mailing address, because they are in NC. I can’t move on to the next step until I list this “mailing address” that is NOT my resident address. 

Please forgive my ignorance, but I want to vote! Can anyone help me figure out how to proceed with this? I’ll go in person (masked, obviously)  if I need to to vote, but I know I have to be registered first!

I don't know where else to post this,"I had to write out my thoughts after last night. It hurt to watch so much and I wanted to know why. I hope it's okay if I pay this here.

Jesus Christ - the debate was miserable. Trump did nothing but bully somebody trying to stay on topic. To add to that, he decided to say the election can't be trusted and that - basically - the Proud Boys should ""guard"" the polls. Fuck Trump. He deserves a major epic-scale loss on election day. And after that, prison. I want to see justice. Can you believe that in 2020, I might lose my right to healthcare, people can be jailed again for abortions, and that the right to same-sex marriage can just suddenly go back to ""not being a thing."" Memphis is my hometown. I grew up in the south. That city and that region molded a lot of who I am, for better or worse, and even I can see the terrifying tragedy of the moment. Half the country has lost it's ability to care about it's fellow citizen. Does Obamacare actually harm you? Does Roe v Wade actually harm you? If you change your perspective for five damn seconds you realize that there's nothing at stake for you. But, when it comes to ""liberals"" like me, we stand to lose the right to healthcare and are subject to exploitation and abuse by profit-driven health ""care"" companies. We stand to lose hope that people of color can actually witness empathy from a government who has killed them for centuries. We stand to go back to draconian times where women would have to hide and risk their lives so they can have one at all. We stand to lose a simple basic right that two people should be treated fairly under the rational definition of marriage. Tell me, please, what do Republicans have at stake? Zoning laws? A lop-sided, unfair court? The right… not to choose? I struggle to see love from you, Republicans, and I include my family in that. You cannot say you care and then smile as you watch what keeps me alive collapsing. You are selectively sociopathic, able to compartmentalize when love is appropriate and when it gets in the way. Churches across this country are filled with you. Seats meant for active compassion filled by cold, fear-driven hearts. I'm not a fan of guns at all, yet somehow I can talk with gun owners (because I actually believe it's more bi-partisan than the NRA wants you to know.) But, somehow the cult huffing the Trump-glue do not see me as a fellow American, and the thing I'm struggling with is that I'm beginning to feel the same way about you, those who vote Trump. This isn't a good thing and it's only going to get darker as the storm clouds of Trump descends on the festival by the river. He'll do his damndest to make sure the waters rise higher and higher, drowning all who attend, regardless of beliefs, regardless of loyalty, regardless of spirit. He is anti-love.

About Trump mentioning Biden’s son,"As someone who has grown up in a household full of addiction, and struggled with addiction myself, Biden showed pure empathy, understanding, and humbleness when he admitted his son used to be an addict. He didn’t have to, it was a private manner unrelated to the election, and yet he owned up to it. It sent chills down my spine and almost brought a tear to my eye when he said what he did about it. Never have I witnessed a politician be human and admit faults. 

Trump can’t even own up to his tax records, and Biden was able to swallow his pride and set the record straight. 

I was undecided before this debate (I knew I wasn’t voting trump, but was considering third party) but after hearing Biden last night, I know who I’m voting for.",1,"trump mentioning biden ’ sonas someone grown household full addiction , struggled addiction , biden showed pure empathy , understanding , humbleness admitted son used addict . ’ , private manner unrelated election , yet owned . sent chills spine almost brought tear eye said . never witnessed politician human admit faults . trump ’ even tax records , biden able swallow pride set record straight . undecided debate ( knew ’ voting trump , considering third party ) hearing biden last night , know ’ voting ."

YSK that Trump's debate tactic has a name: Gish Gallop,"[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish\_Gallop](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop)

The **Gish Gallop** is the [fallacious](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy) [debate](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Debate) tactic of drowning your opponent in a flood of individually-weak [arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument) in order to prevent rebuttal of the whole argument collection without great effort. The Gish Gallop is a conveyor belt-fed version of the [on the spot fallacy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/On_the_spot_fallacy), as it's unreasonable for anyone to have a well-composed answer *immediately* available to every argument present in the Gallop. The Gish Gallop is named after [creationist](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Creationist) [Duane Gish](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Duane_Gish), who often abused it.

Although it takes a trivial amount of effort on the Galloper's part to make each individual point before skipping on to the next (especially if they cite from a pre-concocted list of Gallop arguments), a refutation of the same Gallop may likely take much longer and require significantly more effort (per [the basic principle](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Entropy) that it's always easier to *make a mess* than to clean it back up again).

The tedium inherent in untangling a Gish Gallop typically allows for very little ""creative license"" or vivid [rhetoric](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rhetoric) (in deliberate contrast to the exciting point-dashing central to *the Galloping*), which in turn risks boring the audience or readers, further loosening the refuter's grip on the crowd.

This is especially true in that the Galloper need only [win *a single one* out of all his component arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/One_single_proof) in order to be able to [cast doubt on the entire refutation attempt](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/FUD). For this reason, the refuter *must* achieve a 100% success ratio (with all the yawn-inducing elaboration that goes with such precision). Thus, Gish Galloping is frequently employed (with particularly devastating results) in timed debates. The same is true for any time- or character-limited debate medium, including [Twitter](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Twitter) and newspaper editorials.

Gish Gallops are almost always performed with numerous other logical fallacies baked in. The myriad component arguments constituting the Gallop may typically intersperse *a few* perfectly uncontroversial claims — the basic validity of which are intended to lend undue credence to the Gallop at large — with a devious hodgepodge of [half-truths](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lying_by_omission), outright [lies](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lie), [red herrings](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Red_herring) and [straw men](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man) — which, if not rebutted as the fallacies they are, pile up into egregious problems for the refuter.

There may also be [escape hatches](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Escape_hatch) or [""gotcha"" arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gotcha_argument) present in the Gallop, which are — like the Gish Gallop itself — specifically designed to be brief *to pose*, yet [take a long time to unravel and refute](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/One-way_hash_argument).

However, Gish Gallops aren't impossible to defeat — just tricky (not to say near-impossible for the unprepared). Upon closer inspection, many of the *allegedly stand-alone* component arguments may turn out to be [nothing but thinly-veiled repetitions or simple rephrasings of the same basic points](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/PRATT) — which only makes the list *taller*, not more correct (hence; ""proof *by verbosity*""). This essential flaw in the Gallop means that a skilled rebuttal of *one* component argument may in fact be a rebuttal to *many*.",1,"ysk trump 's debate tactic name : gish gallop [ https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/gish\_gallop ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/gish_gallop ) **gish gallop** [ fallacious ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/logical_fallacy ) [ debate ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/debate ) tactic drowning opponent flood individually-weak [ arguments ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/argument ) order prevent rebuttal whole argument collection without great effort . gish gallop conveyor belt-fed version [ spot fallacy ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/on_the_spot_fallacy ) , 's unreasonable anyone well-composed answer *immediately* available every argument present gallop . gish gallop named [ creationist ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/creationist ) [ duane gish ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/duane_gish ) , often abused . although takes trivial amount effort galloper 's part make individual point skipping next ( especially cite pre-concocted list gallop arguments ) , refutation gallop may likely take much longer require significantly effort ( per [ basic principle ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/entropy ) 's always easier *make mess* clean back ) . tedium inherent untangling gish gallop typically allows little `` creative license '' vivid [ rhetoric ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/rhetoric ) ( deliberate contrast exciting point-dashing central *the galloping* ) , turn risks boring audience readers , loosening refuter 's grip crowd . especially true galloper need [ win *a single one* component arguments ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/one_single_proof ) order able [ cast doubt entire refutation attempt ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/fud ) . reason , refuter *must* achieve 100 % success ratio ( yawn-inducing elaboration goes precision ) . thus , gish galloping frequently employed ( particularly devastating results ) timed debates . true time- character-limited debate medium , including [ twitter ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/twitter ) newspaper editorials . gish gallops almost always performed numerous logical fallacies baked . myriad component arguments constituting gallop may typically intersperse *a few* perfectly uncontroversial claims — basic validity intended lend undue credence gallop large — devious hodgepodge [ half-truths ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/lying_by_omission ) , outright [ lies ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/lie ) , [ red herrings ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/red_herring ) [ straw men ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/straw_man ) — , rebutted fallacies , pile egregious problems refuter . may also [ escape hatches ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/escape_hatch ) [ `` gotcha '' arguments ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/gotcha_argument ) present gallop , — like gish gallop — specifically designed brief *to pose* , yet [ take long time unravel refute ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/one-way_hash_argument ) . however , gish gallops n't impossible defeat — tricky ( say near-impossible unprepared ) . upon closer inspection , many *allegedly stand-alone* component arguments may turn [ nothing thinly-veiled repetitions simple rephrasings basic points ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/pratt ) — makes list *taller* , correct ( hence ; `` proof *by verbosity* '' ) . essential flaw gallop means skilled rebuttal *one* component argument may fact rebuttal *many* ."

Should the Democrats pursue partitioning certain states in order to elect additional Senators?,"The Democrats have structural disadvantages in the Senate, which leads to disadvantages in appointing Supreme Court Justices and other judges. In 2018, for example, Democratic Senate candidates collectively beat Republicans by a large margin, but the Republicans still gained seats in the Senate.

Democrats could work to bridge the gap by partitioning blue states. California, New York, and Massachusetts could likely each be partitioned in such a way that the states are still safe Democratic states, potentially leading to six more Democratic Senators. If DC is granted statehood as well, that could lead to eight more Democratic Senators. (I feel Puerto Rico should be offered statehood if the population agrees, but I believe it's presumptuous to assume their Senators would be Democrats.)

Partitioning efforts have been frequent in California, with the most recent proposal in 2018. New York saw proposals for partitioning Long Island as recently as 2010. Massachusetts hasn't had any serious proposals in the recent past, so that may be more of a long shot.

YOU can help fight voter suppression!,"We are constantly telling people to vote, but we rarely help spread information ABOUT the process of voting. It's important that we make sure people are knowledgeable about and prepared for voting! 

Here's a list of things you can do to help everyone make sure their voices are heard in the upcoming elections:

1. Make sure you're registered to vote and show people how they can easily check online. Here's one way to check: [https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote/voter-registration-status](https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote/voter-registration-status)
2. Know your state's voter laws! What identification do you need, does your state accept absentee voting without excuse, etc. Know if there's any tricky rules/mishaps that can get your ballot discarded! Do you need a security envelope? Find out!!
3. SHARE your state's voter info!!! On any platform you can, with whoever you can! Make sure your community's voice is being heard. 
4. Host zoom parties to help people fill out ballots together. You can research and answer questions together, so that less mistakes are made and many questions can be answered at once!
5. Become a poll worker! There is a shortage of poll workers right now, and you could be PAID. 

The most important part of voting in this election is being prepared to vote, so let's help people prepare instead of just saying""vote vote vote"" over and over. Too many people's voices have been lost because they've shown up to elections and found out they aren't registered or because they signed in the wrong place on their ballot. YOU can help by speeding the word and getting involved, which is something you can do from home!

Don't Know Where Else To Say This,"Watched the debate like most everyone else here, and I don't know where else to go to post my opinion on this. 

Long-time Republican from a family of Republicans. Grew up in NC in a well-off family. Always voted down party lines, but mostly because I was too lazy to actually look up what the candidates stood for. In 2016, voted for Trump because I felt that he could fix the economy with his business experience (I was hit particularly hard from the great recession) and because Hillary was shady as shit (mostly because of what happened with Benghazi). I figured ""hell at least he's better than her, what's the worst he could do?""

Flash forward to some time around 2018 when I was reading about Trump's connections to Russia and his actions just started to make sense. I realized that ""this guy is going to get us all killed or at best turn all of our allies against us, and that's exactly what our enemies want. Of course Russia supports him and China is silently fighting the trade war on their terms...they want him to self-destruct us!""

So, I started considering not voting for Trump again, and voicing this to my family. My wife thinks I'm crazy. She thinks he does no wrong and the bad things that happen in our country just happen and no one could have done anything better. There is always an excuse for why things aren't Trump's fault or it's ""fake news"". I honestly can't tell if she is actually batshit crazy or I am anymore. 

Watching the debate tonight, it was so refreshing hearing Biden act like a fucking normal president would. I feel like our country is already in such a worse place than it was 4 years ago, and I live in a part of the country that is pretty Red. It's such a sinking feeling in my stomach to think of Trump being re-elected. I know I can only cast my vote once and can't control what others do. Feels bad. 

Sorry for the soap box, not sure where else to write all this that won't get downvoted into oblivion.

Edit: Forgot to mention that when I talk to my wife about voting for Biden she says ""says the guy who voted for Trump"", like can I not change my mind now? Is that not allowed? Can I not say I made a mistake and if I knew then what I know now things would be different?

A Suggestion To The Biden Campaign Managers (And to anyone raising money and text banking),"""Hey it's Kamala.  Doesn't Joe remind you of what a president should be like on the debate stage?  Joe's on stage with Trump right now, and we have to show him our support.  We set a goal to raise $5.2M from texts like these before Wednesday, and we're relying on supporters like you to help make it happen.  Will you chip in $12 now?""

Why would you send out a text that containing lies (Joe did not perform particularly presidentially, and saying that Kamala sent the text is just silly) and then ask me for money?  Do you really expect a text like that to do anything but annoy people?  

I gave you money before because I believe that Democrats fight for the facts and fight to give the most people better lives.  I'm guessing that's true of many other Democrats.  How can your campaign more effectively embody that to both raise support and raise the money you clearly so urgently want?

By providing value.  

How?

Use the numbers that you have collected to provide your supporters with facts to counteract the lies being told on-stage.  That certainly doesn't mean sending a text every minute, but rather calling out the boldest of Trumps lies and providing us with sources that prove it.  Preferably ones that are as unbiased as possible and not just news articles or words from Biden's website.

By doing this, you demonstrate your belief in truth and provide supporters with effective resources to point others to and reduce the spread of false information.  In addition, I might start thinking ""Wow, they're really putting my money to good use!  Maybe I should donate more and help them.""

To anyone who reads this, please point out any flaws in the idea.  It is totally possible that I'm just ignorant of how campaigns and text banking works or not thinking things through fully.  

If you like the idea, let's work together to find out how to improve campaign activities so we can win this goddamn election.",1,"suggestion biden campaign managers ( anyone raising money text banking ) '' hey 's kamala . n't joe remind president like debate stage ? joe 's stage trump right , show support . set goal raise $ 5.2m texts like wednesday , 're relying supporters like help make happen . chip $ 12 ?

I stuck with who to vote for.,"I believe in capitalism, low taxes and focus on managing the budget, and I believe that we need law enforcement to stop the riots and to have someone from outside the police department to do investigations involving their officers. I 100% disagree with defunding or bringing a social worker with a official to a shots fired call. I believe the officers need to be more transparent with their rules of deadly force as what I learned from criminal justice involving deadly force gave me a completely different view of how these bad innocent situations happen. 

I also believe in lgbt rights as I’m gay. I don’t care if your homophobic that’s your life but it should not prevent me from living mines.

I believe Americans have to right to buy a weapon as gun violence is increasing we need to protect ourselves. Background check need to be a must. We need to fund officers to do their job as some police departments don’t have enough funding to protect their community to stop these wrongful gun owners.

My inspiration is Robert Kennedy as he was like me who wanted to end division as he said:

 “We can move in that direction as a country, in greater polarization - black people amongst blacks, and white amongst whites, filled with hatred toward one another. Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand and to comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand, compassion and love.... What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.”

Registered to vote,"Hey guys. I’m located in Texas and I’m 20 years old. 2 years ago I had registered to vote for the Texas senate  and since, I have moved to a new house. I still live in the same county (just 4 minutes away from my previous home) and i got a registration form in the mail (it has my current address) but i don’t know if I’m supposed to sign in (and make any changes to it) and mail it back or if I’m not supposed to change anything and leave it as it is.

Does anyone know somewhere I can volunteer to help drive (ideally Democrat) voters to the polls in Pennsylvania?,"I've been trying to find somewhere to volunteer to help drive people to the polls on election day in Pennsylvania.

I live in North Jersey and we are 100% vote-by-mail thanks to Murphey. I signed up to be a poll worker but I don't think I'm getting any response since the few polls that will be open are primarily just places to drop off your mail-in ballot. 

I've been trying to find some place to volunteer to help drive people to the polls in PA since it's a swing state but it's almost impossible to find an organization organizing it. The website for Drive the Vote is gone with no info, Carpool Vote is still functioning, but that's mainly to help drive one or two people along your path to vote.

The best one I can find is rideshare2vote.com but the closest state they are active in is West Virginia. Does anyone know of any local democratic party  or organization organizing rides to the polls in PA? Otherwise I think I might just take the 4-5 hour drive to West VA the night before Nov 3rd to help there.

I've also been letter writing and phone banking but I want something I can do to be directly involved on election day, and ideally somewhere I can make a difference, which is why I was looking at PA.

Does it ever get better?,"I’m a young democrat- as in 2016 was my first election. At the time, it felt like we were fighting tooth and nail for the dignity of our country and our quality of life/rights. When the results came in in 2016,
I was an emotional wreck for a while. Obviously many of my fears came true, and my life has gone from wonderful and fulfilling to an isolated nightmare. Now it feels like we’re fighting for the same things as in 2016- except the stakes are even higher and even more lives are on the line.

So I want to ask of “older democrats”- does it ever get better? Is every presidential election such a desperate and exhausting fight to protect each other? Or is Trump an exception. Bearing the emotional weight of an election of this calibre of importance every four years is something that feels impossible.

I appreciate anything you guys have to say.

Help an Aussie to Understand,"Hey all, Aussie with a thought/questions and looking for some feedback. Before I begin I want to be clear this will be post both here and over at r/Republican assuming moderators from both sides are comfortable with the introspection.

So, whenever one of your political leaders is shown to have done something even their peers find reprehensible (Trump's Ukraine call, Hillary's private email server), the immediate reaction is a whataboutism attacking either the other leader or even just a dubious individual or group from across the aisle. This essentially confirms the disapproval of the favoured leader's actions, otherwise the actions would be plainly defensible outright, no?

This just seems so dopey yet 9/10 its the go-to response, and I know there are smart cookies on both sides. We don't do this to the same degree over here and if anything the party leader is crowned king dipstick and most open to criticism. Your candidates just seem to have ethical rap sheets that could circumnavigate the globe, with any item seeming ripe for disqualification. Both parties have had respectable leaders in the past and most people know somebody in their personal lives they respect - so this is possible. My thinking is that if dems/republicans were more critical of their leaders they might actually build an environment for worthwhile candidates to rise, which might then lead to candidates more palatable to voters across the political spectrum? If ever I had the chance to vote for a respectable candidate of any political leaning that wasn't dripping slime I'd jump at it. Seems like a cut the nose off to spite the face approach to me, or at least spite the other team.

So truly, what's going on here? At first I'd guess it's a compassionate understanding that we all make mistakes, but when it only really applies to one's team captain I'm left stumped.

*Disclaimer: Because it is sure to matter, most of our Aussie politicians from the major parties are spineless centrists so I am not heavily invested in either team. Regardless of the current candidates I don't believe my aligned values of integrity, fortitude and equality are the exclusive property of either US party.*",1,"help aussie understandhey , aussie thought/questions looking feedback . begin want clear post r/republican assuming moderators sides comfortable introspection . , whenever one political leaders shown done something even peers find reprehensible ( trump 's ukraine call , hillary 's private email server ) , immediate reaction whataboutism attacking either leader even dubious individual group across aisle . essentially confirms disapproval favoured leader 's actions , otherwise actions would plainly defensible outright , ? seems dopey yet 9/10 go-to response , know smart cookies sides . n't degree anything party leader crowned king dipstick open criticism . candidates seem ethical rap sheets could circumnavigate globe , item seeming ripe disqualification . parties respectable leaders past people know somebody personal lives respect - possible . thinking dems/republicans critical leaders might actually build environment worthwhile candidates rise , might lead candidates palatable voters across political spectrum ? ever chance vote respectable candidate political leaning n't dripping slime 'd jump . seems like cut nose spite face approach , least spite team . truly , 's going ? first 'd guess 's compassionate understanding make mistakes , really applies one 's team captain 'm left stumped . *disclaimer : sure matter , aussie politicians major parties spineless centrists heavily invested either team . regardless current candidates n't believe aligned values integrity , fortitude equality exclusive property either us party . *"

Trump bringing up Hunter Biden’s drug use history is a new rock bottom for American Politics,"In the entirety of that shitshow that we the American people have to call our “presidential debate”, Trump mentioning the drug use and mental health history of Hunter Biden was by far my least favorite part. If you look more into the history of the life Hunter Biden has lived, he was in a car crash where he lost his mother and younger sister, and suffered a childhood brain injury. He then lost his only remaining sibling from Joe’s first marriage to brain cancer when Beau Biden passed in 2015. He has had anything but an easy life, and as someone who personally has had some struggles with substance use I found this to be disgraceful. How can we ever get past the mental health stigma when our president thinks someone’s child’s addiction is a means to discredit them in an argument? Especially when it’s so obvious as to why Hunter happened to turn to drug use? I knew trump was a disgrace, but this is a new low.",1,"trump bringing hunter biden ’ drug use history new rock bottom american politicsin entirety shitshow american people call “ presidential debate ” , trump mentioning drug use mental health history hunter biden far least favorite part . look history life hunter biden lived , car crash lost mother younger sister , suffered childhood brain injury . lost remaining sibling joe ’ first marriage brain cancer beau biden passed 2015. anything easy life , someone personally struggles substance use found disgraceful . ever get past mental health stigma president thinks someone ’ child ’ addiction means discredit argument ? especially ’ obvious hunter happened turn drug use ? knew trump disgrace , new low ."

Pledge Request,"I Pledge to give the Biden Campaign $5 for each day that Trump is in the Hospital due to his own Careless and Destructive Leadership.

Please Join me.

Hopefully this is permissible in the community.  In any case, I'm serious.  I've already given more to Biden / Lincoln Project / Jaime Harrison than I've ever given to anyone during an Election year, but I can do a bit more.

Based on the number of people now coming out of that Rose Garden ceremony with positive tests, there were probably a WHOLE BUNCH of already infected people at the event, which assured that there was active virus all over the place for a very effective spread.

And why?  Because trump has led in a culture of unconcern about the reality and seriousness of the virus, and it is HIS LEADERSHIP that created this destructive situation.

Just wait till his lies about Climate Change (and so many other issues) become (more) clear.

He needs to go.

"Opinion and Proposition: To ensure a speedy recovery from the coronavirus, President Trump should resign from office","I read earlier today that [Twiter will start suspending users wishing for Donald Trump's death after being diagnosed with COVID.](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitter-suspend-users-wishing-trump-dead-1234791263/)  I think this is valid, as COVID is a very dangerous disease that is devastating to a person's health and very painful, and could lead to death.  In fact, I encourage the opposite:  I wish Trump and other members of government including senators, representatives, cabinet members, and cabinet secretaries who are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus a speedy recovery and return to health.

But, running for office and running the government must be so incredibly stressful and exhausting, and complicated to do from a hospital bed.  On NPR yesterday, they said that Trump prefers receiving his security briefs in person, and being isolated in the hospital could complicate how the President receives his security briefings with his staff.

But I propose that President Trump need not worry about security briefs, and the other duties of president, by *resigning from office*.  Resigning from the Presidency will allow him to focus on getting better and healthy while he fights COVID.  He will need all of the strength that God can give him to battle his deadly disease.  Because, what's more important for President Trump?  That he die from COVID, or survive so that he could re-run for the presidency in 2024?  Or enjoying retirement after working so hard serving the country for nearly four years?

I think that any other member of government that also contracts COVID should also resign so they can recover speedily.  And also to prevent other members of government from catching the disease and dying, or being bed-ridden for weeks, possibly months, affecting how our country functions!

I'm not on Twitter or other social media besides Facebook, so please, tweet this message, post it on Instagram, or Snapchat, and all the other social medias:

What has the Trump Administration done with regards to China?,"With the election coming, everyone I've talked to says that China is the biggest threat, and that the Trump Administration is doing lots of stuff against China given what China has done (rebuking them, sanctions, etc).

Putting aside his tweets, I'm trying to find out in good faith what exactly has the administration done with regards to China and their recent activity? I guess I'm trying to understand why China 'should be #1' in my list of concerns when voting, as others have mentioned.

Chill Out with the whole Trump faking Covid Conspiracy,"I'm not saying it's beneath team Trump to pull a stunt like that, BUT, we have to look at the facts and really ask, ""Is it even surprising Trump contracted Covid?"" I mean really, the guy almost never wears a mask or social distances and comes into contact with dozens of different people every day. The only parts of this that are hard to believe is that 1) Trump didn't catch it sooner 2) Melania got close enough to him to catch it (of course, entirely possible she got it from someone else or same person Trump did).  


It's VERY hard for me to believe that Trump would fake an illness so close to election day when he Knows he is losing. He loves getting out there and campaigning, it's literally one of the only things he truly enjoys as president, you think he'd willingly give that up for two weeks just before an election. And finally, despite what the general public thought, Trump thinks he killed it at that debate He was very likely looking forward to the next two, not looking for ways to get out of them.  


Remember too, that the White House didn't announce Hicks was positive, a reporter scooped it. If anything, the White House was going to try and keep this a secret.

"Democrats: if we want to consign the GOP to the electoral dustbin of history, we need to change the way we talk about abortion. Now is the absolute best time to start","I encourage everyone seeing this to read [this excellent piece](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/02/trump-suburbs-white-women-michigan-423870) from Tim Alberta about Elissa Slotkin's Michigan district. It’s a long piece, so I’ll quote the relevant part:

>When Slotkin’s speech wrapped up, I got to talking with two middle-aged women who were sitting in lawn chairs. **Rachel Babich and Karen Kudla both described themselves as longtime Republicans whose loyalty to the party owed largely to the issue of abortion.** Both are teachers—Kudla is now retired—and both are moms. Despite being offended by Trump four years ago, neither of them could bear to vote for Hillary Clinton.

>“I’ve been a single-issue Republican, a pro-life voter, for a very long time. But Trump changed my thinking in that regard,” Babich explained. **“I’ve had it with this idea that you’re only pro-life if you fight against abortion. I’ve come to see there’s a much better way to be pro-life, and that’s making sure our social programs are funded, making sure our climate crisis is dealt with, making sure DREAMers are being protected. That’s pro-life, too.”**

>Kudla jumped in. **“What about day care? What about paying good wages? What about helping women support their babies? Those are pro-life policies. And we don’t hear anything about them,”** she said. “Shame on us. Shame on us. I’m a devout Catholic; I pray the rosary every morning. I am so conflicted about all these things. But I cannot in good conscience vote to keep this man in the White House.”

>“Look,” Babich sighed, “I would love to see abortion not be practiced. But I would also love to see women supported to the point where they never have to make a choice between an abortion and a job, an abortion and living in poverty, an abortion and being left behind by society. I don’t want unborn children being killed. It’s awful. But **I can’t think of a more anti-life policy than to put a poor woman in a position where she has no options, where a pregnancy traps her into a life of poverty she can’t escape.”**

The way, by and large, that we Democrats have long talked about abortion -- as a question of pro-choice vs. pro-life -- creates two major, and connected, structural disadvantages for anyone with a D next to their name. First, it buys into the Republicans’ framing of the issue, enabling them to gin up enthusiasm with it almost at will, to the point where Democrats are often afraid to even mention it. But furthermore, it cedes *substantial* emotional ground to the GOP in the eyes of voters like these two. As has been said here and elsewhere, if you think abortion is murder then you’re almost never going to support a candidate who isn’t opposed to it.

But buying into the frame of abortion as allowing it or banning it almost *forces* those voters to go for the GOP, because they will likely suffer some degree of emotional trauma (“I’m supporting a baby-killer?!”) if they don’t. Therefore, **I propose we shift our focus** from talking about whether abortion should be legal to **why women get abortions,** and how we can **reduce the number of abortions performed,** a framing of the issue voters like the two women above can absolutely get behind.

An obvious first part of how you accomplish that is with properly funded education and contraception. These should absolutely be on any Democrat’s platform, and it is for many of them. But there is a much more salient line of advocacy, especially to pro-lifers: **many women have abortions because they simply cannot afford to support a child.** Unintended pregnancies are [**five times more common** for women living in poverty compared to those with middle or high income.](https://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2019/05/who-are-the-1-in-4-american-women-who-choose-abortion/)


The Republicans, with their constant opposition to policies like paid family and sick leave or affordable daycare and healthcare, policies that actually would help to *ease the burden* on women, and on families generally, of having a child, are in fact **indirectly encouraging women to get abortions.** We have all said or heard [variations on the theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvF1Q3UidWM) that Republicans only care about babies before they’re born, and cease giving a damn the moment they start having needs their mother can’t intravenously(?) provide.

So why aren’t we nailing them with that?? *Of course* a poor woman is going to get an abortion if she doesn’t have access to good healthcare to ensure she can stay healthy during the pregnancy, or affordable daycare for when the baby is born, or a job that barely pays enough to feed herself, let alone a whole ‘nother person. Say it again with me: **by denying support for these basic policies and services, Republicans are incentivizing women to abort their babies, because they have made it incredibly costly to have a child.**

This is how we dislodge single-issue abortion voters away from the GOP, just like those two women above are contemplating. The Republicans are happy to bludgeon away at the issue, touting their “pro-life records” as if that actually means anything, all the while having done *nothing*, outside of a few crackpot state gov’t bills, to actually reduce abortions. And in fact, they’re actively increasing them! We should hold them accountable for that!

Democrats should become the *real* “Pro-Life Party”, by supporting policies that don’t corner women into either having an abortion or becoming a parent in abysmal circumstances with the deck *already stacked against the child*. Democrats believe in policies that provide support to both mother and child, regardless of the circumstances, and that support will make **far more gains** in pursuit of reducing abortion than Republicans have ever achieved in over 40 years of blathering about it.

Now this doesn’t mean we’re all of a sudden not going to be supporting safe, legal abortion, and it is still the law of the land, after all. But if we can effectively reframe our language on abortion in this way, it could be a tremendous opportunity to finally go on offense against the Republicans over the *one issue* that has failed to move substantially in our direction over the decades. 

This is a fight Biden can start right now! [Abortion is the top issue for 46% of Trump voters.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election/) I have read piece after piece this cycle about single issue voters who are sticking with Trump only because of the abortion issue. **If Democrats can crack that support group and wedge even a few points away from the GOP, they will cease to be an electable party in this country.** It is time we take the fight to them, and fight for the supportive, practical policies that can make it easier for women to decide in favor of having a child, and in turn make our country and its citizens stronger and healthier.

2021 -universal healthcare approved in lets say Feb.
-Everyone gets there policy by say april 2021
- lets say a child falls and chips break a front tooth requiring a false mold made by dentist ...lets say this happens in May..
-you call a dentist and instead of getting a appointment date you instead would be put on a waiting list ( most likely 6 to 12 months down the line) due to everyone needing and attempting to get work done .. 

This to me sounds ABSURD.. Basically i was told your put on a equvilant of a transplant list and have to wait for you or your minors name to come up..

I was an ardent Trump supporter that has recently switched.,"This is a post I never thought I would ever be making, but here we are. Throughout 2020 i used to be terrified of the “far left” or the “radical left” and that’s why i really wanted Trump.

I along with many in my shoes, have came to a hard realization after this debate. Donald Trump isn’t good for this country. Country over party.

I came to the realization that his whole campaign this year has just been anti-democrat, his whole campaign has been about dividing America, not building it up. This is far different than the Trump of 2016.

My true switch moment happened when Joe Biden called for unity during the debate. That he wanted to work with everybody. Donald on the other hard blamed the democrats for everything, which is against every foundation i have that is America first.

So this is why I’ve switched. I want a president that wants the best for America, not the best for himself or his own party.",1,"ardent trump supporter recently switched.this post never thought would ever making , . throughout 2020 used terrified “ far left ” “ radical left ” ’ really wanted trump . along many shoes , came hard realization debate . donald trump ’ good country . country party . came realization whole campaign year anti-democrat , whole campaign dividing america , building . far different trump 2016. true switch moment happened joe biden called unity debate . wanted work everybody . donald hard blamed democrats everything , every foundation america first . ’ switched . want president wants best america , best party ."
Can’t Register in Florida in time 😞,"I have been living in Florida since February so i meet the criteria to be considered a Florida resident, but i never went to the DMV to officially get my Florida drivers license.

Today I JUST received the documentation i need to be able to register to vote in Florida. I have an appt at the DMV Monday the 5th to become a Florida resident. But, the DMV typically takes 2-3 weeks to send their license. So I won’t get my license in time. And, apparently they can’t print drivers licenses on the spot. 

I don’t suppose anyone has any other ideas?

Update: I called the DMV this morning and they confirmed they issue the license on the spot.  So, I'll just go straight to register afterwards.

I just think it's important that we don't just get distracted by the next scandal, and keep track of everything he's done.

Here's what I have for the month of September so far:

[He's told people of North Carolina to vote twice](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/politics/trump-people-vote-twice.html) 

(Published 9-2-2020)

&#x200B;

[4 Anonymous sources from the Trump administration reported that Trump called American soldiers, who died for their country, ""losers"" and ""suckers""](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/) 

(Published 9-3-2020)

&#x200B;

[His tax returns were released, revealing he only paid $750 in 2016](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html) 

(Published 9-27-2020)

\- This also revealed extremely shady and possibly illegal business right offs.

\- It also revealed the reason why he's under audit: a $72.9 million tax refund that he may have (and like did) fraudulently obtain for ""abandonment"" of a business he was a chairman of.

\- Also, his taxes showed that he has roughly $421 million in debt to some unknown entity. This is a huge conflict of interest and opens him up to be a national security threat.

[Donald Trump refused to condemn white supremacy, told the hate group, Proud Boys, to ""stand back and stand by"", as well as urging his supporters to become illegal poll watchers, all during an incredibly embarrassing debate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&ab_channel=C-SPAN) 

(Published 9/29/2020)

\-[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/wW1lY5jFNcQ?t=5551) Chris Wallace asks if he's willing to condemn white supremacist groups and tell them to stand down. Trump refuses to do so. He says ""sure I'm willing do do that, but I would say, I would say almost everything I see is from the left"", however never does condemn them.

\- [1:33:36](https://youtu.be/wW1lY5jFNcQ?t=5614) Trump says ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by, but I'll you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's gotta do something about Antifa and the left."" Which can easily be interpreted as an endorsement of the group.

\- [1:39:08](https://youtu.be/wW1lY5jFNcQ?t=5948) Trump attacks Biden and his son over his former drug problem.

\- [1:59:19](https://youtu.be/wW1lY5jFNcQ?t=7159) Chris Wallace asks ""Will you urge your supporters to stay calm, during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest, and will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified?"" Donald Trump responded by saying ""I'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully. Because that's what has to happen. I'm urging them to do it."" This is illegal.

&#x200B;

[The following day, Trump denies he knows who the Proud Boys are, and continues to not condemn them.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/01/politics/donald-trump-debate-election-2020-joe-biden/index.html)

"As a Venezuelan, I can say that Trump is using the same dirty strategies that Chavez used to get immoderate power in Venezuela and therefore destroy our country. Here's why","This is something that I suspected since 2015. I'm not a leftist, but I can't endorse a person that promotes divisionism, racism, someone that wants to disrupt democracy and freedom of speech in a country. This guy has been using the same populist and disgusting tactics that Chavez used to fool people and get away with it in his first term.

Yesterday I was watching the presidential debate and I felt a hard pain in my stomach while listening to this a-hole, it was like watching the same guy that brought misery to Venezuela, but on the other side of the spectrum, yet still, both being the same kind of person.

These are some of the things I noticed:

&#x200B;

* This guy wants to do the same as Chavez in the early 2000s with our supreme justice tribunal, fill it with ""loyal"" people that will defend him over the worst cases of crime and corruption.
* Calling the press as ""fake news"" and attempting against freedom of speech to invalidate any kind of criticism or allegations against his crimes, the same as Chavez did, closing the biggest TV channel in Venezuela (RCTV) just because they were pointing out all of the corruption that he was creating.
* Making a Cult out of his followers, fooling ignorant people to support him unconsciously just because the ""other ones"" are bad, saying that he loved the country so much, and telling a bunch of lies about the opposition on TV without showing any kind of proof. But his words were always enough because he was ""the president"".
* Divisionism, trying his hard each day to divide the people as reds and blues, and convince the reds that the blues don't care about them and that they should treat them as enemies  (Chavez would talk about this on national TV for 6 hours straight, every day.)
* treating protestors that opposed him and his acts as criminals and terrorists.
* Promoting homophobia and using ""god"" as a tool for planting his bigoted ideas into his follower's brains.
* Gaining the military and police support by giving them privileges so they can stand by his side.

a clear example that both extremes touch at the end.

these are just a small fraction of what he did and have in mind that this was just his early days, things have gotten 50x worse politically, socially, and obviously economically since then.

This idiot can say anything about that he will overthrow Maduro's dictatorship but those are all lies, they're both basically the same, authoritarians that don't want anything but to remain in power at any cost, and they're both backed up by Russia.

Take this guy out before it is too late. I wouldn't wish all the misery that we've lived to anyone.

People talk about how Biden is clueless and doesn’t know what he’s doing... Trump’s attack on his sons proved otherwise to me...,"Can you imagine someone attacking your dead son’s military service and then switching to your live son’s addiction problem (BTW he WASN’T dishonorably discharged, look it up). If we’re going to personal attacks like that I’m sure fucking a pornstar when your wife just had a kid is worse on a side note. But anyways, If I was Biden at that point, I would be MAD. Like as someone who has not lost a son, but a brother, that would piss me off so much.

Today my life-long Republican mother that voted for Trump told me she was going to vote for Biden,"I am just so proud that I needed to share the news! Four years ago, my mother was an obnoxious Trump supporter. So obnoxious in fact that I had to go low contact with her for the first few months following election day and had considered cutting off contact for about a year because she was constantly throwing his win in my face and seemed to deliberately pick fights around Trump and politics.

Well, about 2ish year ago her tune began to change. She said that Trump needed to stop tweeting so much and that he was just constantly sounding like an ass. Slowly but surely she actually seemed to start to dislike the man and was almost as disturbed by the things he said than I was. She eventually said that she just wasn't going to vote at all and I pointed out to her periodically through our conversations the kind of destructive things he was doing, regardless if she agreed with Biden or his policies.

Well, this morning she seemed to make a sudden turn I never expected. She said she was tired of the division that Trump was causing in the country and the hate he was constantly spouting and the only way to stop him was to vote against him. She is going to vote for Biden.

Wow. I never thought it would happen and I thought she would be grasping onto this life raft for the rest of her life until she drowned in the stupidity that Trump seems to represent and attract. But I can proudly say that she didn't let political party history influence her or refuse to admit when she was wrong. So proud!",1,"today life-long republican mother voted trump told going vote bideni proud needed share news ! four years ago , mother obnoxious trump supporter . obnoxious fact go low contact first months following election day considered cutting contact year constantly throwing win face seemed deliberately pick fights around trump politics . well , 2ish year ago tune began change . said trump needed stop tweeting much constantly sounding like ass . slowly surely actually seemed start dislike man almost disturbed things said . eventually said n't going vote pointed periodically conversations kind destructive things , regardless agreed biden policies . well , morning seemed make sudden turn never expected . said tired division trump causing country hate constantly spouting way stop vote . going vote biden . wow . never thought would happen thought would grasping onto life raft rest life drowned stupidity trump seems represent attract . proudly say n't let political party history influence refuse admit wrong . proud !"

"Please help fellow Democrats, first time voter here having trouble registering to vote in my state! Which I need to do ASAP to vote!!!!","I am a SC resident with a valid drivers license. After finding out that I was actually still registered to vote in NC - where my absentee voter ballot was sent to- I went online today to attempt to register in my current state of SC so that I can actually vote.  Given my license number and social security number, the website located my DMV resident address in SC and it was correct. It then asks previous registration state (NC), and previous registration county (Mecklenburg). The next prompt is where it has lost me. 

The website lists in clear, capital red letters “DO NOT ENTER YOUR RESIDENCE ADDRESS AS YOUR MAILING ADDRESS”. What on earth would I list, if not my resident address? I don’t think I can use my parents home as mailing address, because they are in NC. I can’t move on to the next step until I list this “mailing address” that is NOT my resident address. 

Please forgive my ignorance, but I want to vote! Can anyone help me figure out how to proceed with this? I’ll go in person (masked, obviously)  if I need to to vote, but I know I have to be registered first! 

Here is a screenshot of the web page:

I continue with why he was ""hired"" (elected)  for the term, when if someone was hiring a janitor,  they would check their experience  to see if a broom fit in their hand! But Norco, the ""followers"" are tired of career politicians,  so let's go with someone with a resume of bankruptcy,  marital affairs, lawsuits, and a daddy who payed his way.

They then feel the need to say something about our President,  like, he is going to ban red meat! I ask them where they heard that , and here comes Fox news.  They will throw back he is tearing down the fence, letting all the rapists and murderers in. Then I correct what they are claiming.

If they are going to bitch about our President, at least have a reason. Don't  just dislike him because he isn't  the other guy. Know your facts before you gripe, and be prepare to explain them.

Case getting rid of our second amendment right to bear arms.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/26/supreme-court-may-start-striking-down-gun-laws-thats-only-start/

What the second amendment used to say: 

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed

Some quick background. In a 2008 case called District of Columbia v. Heller, the court’s “originalist” conservatives took the text of the Second Amendment and essentially crossed out everything up to and including “free State,” ruling for the first time that the right to bear arms has nothing to do with well-regulated militias

~~A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed~~

The 1934 Mid-Term Elections And Why They Are Relevant,"The ""common wisdom"" is that the President's party loses seats in the mid-terms. I think this claim is obsolete in the Trump Era. I predict that President Biden's party will gain seats because of his popularity.

Of course, if you are a Democrat, you already know that Franklin Roosevelt was elected in 1932 and took office in 1933. So you already know that the 1934 mid-terms was a referendum on FDR's first 100 days and first year in office. What you probably don't know is the results.

 From Wiki:

The Democrats built on the Congressional majorities they had won in the previous two elections. In the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives), Roosevelt's party gained nine seats, mostly from the [Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)). The Democrats also gained nine seats in the [U.S. Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate), thereby winning a supermajority. A [Progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Progressive_Party) also unseated a Republican in the Senate. This marked the first time since the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) that an incumbent president's party gained seats in a midterm election, followed by [1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_1998) and [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_2002).

The election was perhaps the most successful midterm of the 20th century for the party in control of the presidency.

For the People Act...fillibuster options,"I believe that SB1 is the quintessential legislative issue of our time and must be passed.  That being said, I also respect the Senate's role as a deliberative body and as a check on the more unhinged populism of the House of Representatives.

I'm concerned about the GOP using a simple majority next time they're in power to do some really destructive things.  Thus I'm not certain that nuking the filibuster outright would be the best approach.  However, even if we were to bend the rules to allow the bill's passage, I still believe that GOP would use this as justification to circumvent the filibuster anyway, since they're in general way more vindictive and dishonest/shameless than Democrats.

Repeal the Gay Blood Ban,"The Gay Blood Ban is now technically only a 3-month, and until recently 12-month, ""deferral"" (though conservative elements at the FDA and Red Cross fought that one tooth and nail...  Not surprising: in my own personal experience training/volunteering with them in the Midwest, the Red Cross is still full of homophobes in many parts of the country...) but is still effectively a ban on any sexually-active gay man, or bisexual man currently in a same-sex relationship, from giving blood.

This article discusses it:

https://georgetownvoice.com/2021/04/17/gay-men-cant-donate-blood/

This ban, because that's what it really is, needs to stop.  It must end.

As hospitals cried out desperately for blood during the height of this pandemic, it was extremely discouraging knowing, for instance, that as I tried to drag my homophobic father by the ear to give blood with me, I (a only partly out-of-closet bisexual: my father doesn't know) could face some very awkward conversations with a homophobic Red Cross nurse that might risk alerting my nosy father, if I tried to give...  (as it happens I hadn't had any sexual contact with ANYONE in the 3 months before that, and my last sexual relationship had been with a woman anyways: in fact I've been largely abstinent my entire life both due to my own religious reasons/concerns with too much premarital or homosexual sex, and due to having incredible difficulty being accepted in dating...)

This ban coats lives.  It discourages people from giving when there is absolutely no reason for it.  In fact, that liason with a woman I hadn't known long (from internet dating, and SHE was the one who got things sexual by the way) and could have carried any of numerous STD's (condoms were used, but can break or slip...) was inarguably a LOT riskier than a homosexual married couple who had been in an exclusive relationship 20 years would be...

The fact I could've donated the day after screwing a random girl from Tinder who I barely knew, if I wanted, but a committed homosexusl couple would be barred from donating blood for 3 ENTIRE MONTHS after having sex (which, let's face it, no real couple is going to go that long without... so it's effectively a ban) is absolutely incorrigible.

Biden is in office.  Moderate Democrats CLAIM to want to save lives in this pandemic- and the next one.

And a blood shortage costs lives every day (I would know: I'm a biologist and a pre-med, taking my 2nd and 3rd Master's at a Med School- I have shadowed doctors, worked EMS, and have a LOT of academic and incidental exposure to the medical system).  So why don't we get this fixed?",1,"repeal gay blood banthe gay blood ban technically 3-month , recently 12-month , `` deferral '' ( though conservative elements fda red cross fought one tooth nail ... surprising : personal experience training/volunteering midwest , red cross still full homophobes many parts country ... ) still effectively ban sexually-active gay man , bisexual man currently same-sex relationship , giving blood . article discusses : https : //georgetownvoice.com/2021/04/17/gay-men-cant-donate-blood/ ban , 's really , needs stop . must end . hospitals cried desperately blood height pandemic , extremely discouraging knowing , instance , tried drag homophobic father ear give blood , ( partly out-of-closet bisexual : father n't know ) could face awkward conversations homophobic red cross nurse might risk alerting nosy father , tried give ...

A message long forgotten,"Crucially, Socrates was not elitist in the normal sense. He didn’t believe that a narrow few should only ever vote. He did, however, insist that only those who had thought about issues rationally and deeply should be let near a vote. 

We have forgotten this distinction between an intellectual democracy and a democracy by birthright. We have given the vote to all without connecting it to that of wisdom. 

And Socrates knew exactly where that would lead: to a system the Greeks feared above all, demagoguery. dēmos ‘the people’ + agōgos ‘leading Ancient Athens had painful experience of demagogues, for example, the louche figure of Alcibiades, a rich, charismatic, smooth-talking wealthy man who eroded basic freedoms and helped to push Athens to its disastrous military adventures in Sicily. 

Socrates knew how easily people seeking election could exploit our desire for easy answers. He asked us to imagine an election debate between two candidates, one who was like a doctor and the other who was like a sweet shop owner. 

The sweet shop owner would say of his rival: *Look, this person here has worked many evils on you. He hurts you, gives you bitter potions and tells you not to eat and drink whatever you like. He’ll never serve you feasts of many and varied pleasant things like I will.*

Socrates asks us to consider the audience response: Do you think the doctor would be able to reply effectively? The true answer – ‘I cause you trouble, and go against you desires in order to help you’ would cause an uproar among the voters, don’t you think? 

We have forgotten all about Socrates’s salient warnings against democracy. We have preferred to think of democracy as an unambiguous good – rather than a process that is only ever as effective as the education system that surrounds it. **As a result, we have elected many sweet shop owners, and very few doctors**",1,"message long forgottencrucially , socrates elitist normal sense . ’ believe narrow ever vote . , however , insist thought issues rationally deeply let near vote . forgotten distinction intellectual democracy democracy birthright . given vote without connecting wisdom . socrates knew exactly would lead : system greeks feared , demagoguery . dēmos ‘ people ’ + agōgos ‘ leading ancient athens painful experience demagogues , example , louche figure alcibiades , rich , charismatic , smooth-talking wealthy man eroded basic freedoms helped push athens disastrous military adventures sicily . socrates knew easily people seeking election could exploit desire easy answers . asked us imagine election debate two candidates , one like doctor like sweet shop owner . sweet shop owner would say rival : *look , person worked many evils . hurts , gives bitter potions tells eat drink whatever like . ’ never serve feasts many varied pleasant things like . * socrates asks us consider audience response : think doctor would able reply effectively ? true answer – ‘ cause trouble , go desires order help ’ would cause uproar among voters , ’ think ? forgotten socrates ’ salient warnings democracy . preferred think democracy unambiguous good – rather process ever effective education system surrounds . **as result , elected many sweet shop owners , doctors**"

"How much of the Republican opposition to Biden's covid relief package do you think wasn't actually because they didn't think it was covid relief, but rather they didn't want to be seen as helping push Biden's agenda?","The covid relief bill was very popular amongst the public with large bipartisan public support. It really didn't make sense for Republicans to oppose it because their own constituents would be directly benefitting from it. The main excuse used over and again was that it wasn't covid relief. Which now looking at the infrastructure package, you can tell will the excuse Republicans will use for everything Biden wants to pass. They'll claim it's not whatever Biden claims it is.

Anyways, do you really think the Republicans actually think the Covid relief package wasn't really covid relief? Or do you think they don't want to be seen as helping Biden push his agenda? Any Republican who would have voted for the relief would have most likely gotten plenty of attention in the media. It wouldn't have been a bad thing to do to vote for it. But there's a good chance they didn't want to be known to their Republican peers as the person helping Biden succeed. What doy you guys think?",1,"much republican opposition biden 's covid relief package think n't actually n't think covid relief , rather n't want seen helping push biden 's agenda ? covid relief bill popular amongst public large bipartisan public support . really n't make sense republicans oppose constituents would directly benefitting . main excuse used n't covid relief . looking infrastructure package , tell excuse republicans use everything biden wants pass .

Do not believe in this bipartisanship bs spinning that is going on now.,"I have seen multiple articles talking about different things and areas and it being due to bipartisanship.

But every time I read one of those articles all I can think of is that this is not bipartisanship at work.

It is the dems doing what is correct and for the good of the country.

The ''republicans'' are only going along with it since they do not have the numbers to stop it.

If you do not believe me think about this, if the ''republicans'' were the ones with the power would they be doing any of this or would they kill it all.

No, they would not give two shits about any of it.

Right wing indoctrination,"This may be an unconventional post but I think its needed. Recently I've been delving deep into right ideologies and as a result conspiracy theories/false information. I'm beginning to believe and have doubts about COIVD-19, the vaccine, and the current state of the government. I'm looking for the voice of reason here. I don't want to indoctrinate myself and need some fact checking, logical reasoning, and persuasion back to a realistic perspective of our country. 

Here are major points of correction: 

\- The contents of the COVID vaccine; can we trust that the vaccine is safe? Does it contain harmful substances? The government is pushing the vaccine hard, can we trust what they say or is this another case of lobbying and/or government/corporate propaganda? Are the ""jacking"" the vaccine, adding additional ingredients they aren't telling us? It comes down to this; is the vaccine safe to take?

\- Coronavirus has a >\~2% fatality rate, is it really worth it to shut down the economy? The economic impact of COVID is costing many jobs, how are people supposed to pay for rent, food, utilities? Even with stimulus from the government people are still struggling. Is this just a plot against the people?

I'm looking for facts, not a right wing eco chamber to indorenate me further. Can I trust government sentiment? In our modern world there is an influx of information and its hard to tell what's true and what's false. Please correct the misinformation that has plagued me, I need a realist view of our current government. 

\*This is not trolling. I am not looking to debate. I am looking for factually correct information that will give me a realistic view of our country.\*

I'm going to get basted for this but it's truly to illustrate the way I feel about canceling student debt...,"So I want to illustrate why this cancelling of student debt proposal is not the greatest idea:

\- We offer a windfall to some-18% of the population....18%.  This is not a large portion of the population

\- We are offering this to roughly 44.7M people and/or a total of $1.7T in student debt.

Lets assume that the full 100% of the estimated student debt isn't relieved but just a majority.  So we are going to add ANOTHER $1.25T to our national debt to relieve 18% of the population?  And we think this will ""save"" a lot of people and stimulate the economy?  $1.25T is pretty much what our first infrastructure package was to help THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, this helps 18%.

This needs to start by addressing the problem first.  Student loan originators and the schools themselves need to be put into check first and foremost, I want to illustrate with a personal story I had the pleasure of going through with a close friend of mine.

I wanted to help a friend of mine deal with one of these student loan entities, Navient which is one of the larger ones.  Scenario was they had to go into bankruptcy for a completely unrelated reason to student loans back in 2012.  Once he came out of the bankruptcy this loan popped back up on his radar and it was actually a loan he took out for his daughters college schooling.  He shared all the info with me and it is unbelievable the liberties Navient took upon themselves during this time.  It actually stated on the invoice/bill to them directly under the ""Interest Rate"" line item that ""Interest rates on private loans are set by the lender"" so it was set to 11.75%.....are you goddamn fucking for real?  So you just get to set whatever fucking rate you want to?!  Man, I should go out and be a student loan broker....holy fucking shit.  So after I found this out I figured we would be able to call them and negotiate a lower principal buydown if we paid everything right now....as most collection agencies work.  NOPE!  No leniency, he needs to pay it in full either now or later....it doesn't matter we just need the full amount with all interest.

This is all part of the bigger problem.  Schools jack up their rates because they know any kid will get approved for an educational loan because, well fuck, the banks know ""we want the US to get more educated so we will approve anything and the federal loan process allows us to collect from them till the day they die so here, take $200K, we know we will get it back."".  It's a fucking self fulfilling prophecy that, for some reason, the feds back the banks making sure this albatross will be around their necks forever AND they can dictate what the interest rate will be?   

I get that I am illustrating the whole point some people believe why relieving student debt is a must but it's not the right way to do this.  Fix the systemic problem first otherwise it will continue down this path and help nobody.  People who were willing to take out a loan like this should still be responsible for the loan, they agreed to the more simple terms of knowing you were taking out a large amount money to pay for education.  If we want to look at rolling back the clock and putting a cap on the interest rate, that makes sense and I could get behind that but just throwing \~$1.25T at this problem seems frivolous.  I hear people on the very posts about canceling student debt talking about how they would, in turn, go buy a car and a house entering into another form of loan/debt.  If you were willing to enter into a student loan over your head to begin with I don't have a ton of faith those same people will go buy a house or car within their means and large defaults on loans absolutely does not stimulate the economy.  There just needs to be some sort of level of accountability from all levels; loanors, loanees and the educational instituation.

Sorry if this sounds like a rant, it kind of is but I wanted to justify my thoughts behind it and hear others thoughts as well.",1,"'m going get basted 's truly illustrate way feel canceling student debt ... want illustrate cancelling student debt proposal greatest idea : \- offer windfall some-18 % population ... .18 % . large portion population \- offering roughly 44.7m people and/or total $ 1.7t student debt . lets assume full 100 % estimated student debt n't relieved majority . going add another $ 1.25t national debt relieve 18 % population ? think `` save '' lot people stimulate economy ? $ 1.25t pretty much first infrastructure package help entire country , helps 18 % . needs start addressing problem first . student loan originators schools need put check first foremost , want illustrate personal story pleasure going close friend mine . wanted help friend mine deal one student loan entities , navient one larger ones . scenario go bankruptcy completely unrelated reason student loans back 2012. came bankruptcy loan popped back radar actually loan took daughters college schooling . shared info unbelievable liberties navient took upon time . actually stated invoice/bill directly `` interest rate '' line item `` interest rates private loans set lender '' set 11.75 % ... ..are goddamn fucking real ? get set whatever fucking rate want ? ! man , go student loan broker ... .holy fucking shit . found figured would able call negotiate lower principal buydown paid everything right ... .as collection agencies work . nope ! leniency , needs pay full either later ... .it n't matter need full amount interest . part bigger problem . schools jack rates know kid get approved educational loan , well fuck , banks know `` want us get educated approve anything federal loan process allows us collect till day die , take $ 200k , know get back.

"How do you interact or engage with staunchly Conservative family members who are very vocal about their beliefs and have bought into far-right propaganda hook, line, and sinker?","Following the mass shooting in Boulder Colorado I had [an exchange](https://imgur.com/a/Kn6JoyW) with an Aunt and Uncle on Facebook about gun violence. *Click the link to read the full (name-blurred) facebook exchange on Imgur; It's a doozy.*

I tried to be respectful, honest, and factual in my responses, as well as leaving room for them to respond with their point of view. I thought I was giving them the opportunity to detail what they believed and why, but I instead received parroted responses of common far-right talking points with no indication that they took the time to read my responses.

I don't believe the phrase ""you can't reason with some people"" and genuinely what to know how others have handled similar situations. We are cordial enough when we meet in person; I also know them to be generous and good-hearted people. However, the only thing I see them use their facebook accounts for is to continuously share far-right memes that have become increasingly violent and bigoted. More than anything I'm sad that I seem to be losing family members to what I perceive to be a political cult.

I have the opportunity to see them this summer and I am on the fence whether to avoid the family gathering or to attend and pretend as if the exchange never happened. My family is what you would call ""mid-west nice"" and conflict avoidant, so I know my aunt and uncle won't bring it up while I'm there. I am already the black sheep of the family, so I don't really care if they bring it up while I'm not there to other family members, but it hurts me to see people I love live in a world of hate and lies.

I'd love to discuss this with anyone who is willing.

"Lifelong Democrat, but I'm totally against abolishing the Filibuster. Hear me out:","Hello friends. Like you (I presume), I voted for President Biden and he has made me proud with his character and his policies. I'm very-much in support of his national plans, and I'm behind the Democrats in Congress. 

However, this idea of abolishing the Filibuster is absolutely short-sighted and ultimately a bad idea. 

Right now, we (the Democratic party) have a government trifecta, and so the idea of streamlining policies seems like a great idea. We can get *so much accomplished* when we would otherwise just have more partisan gridlock. I recognize the upside to repealing it at this moment; don't think I don't. 

* **However** 

One thing is an absolute fact: the Republicans will regain the majority at some point in the future. To think that the Democrats are going to hold the majority in the senate for the rest of time is insanity. Majorities change. They've changed after Watergate, since Vietnam, since anything. Majorities never hold power in perpetuity. 

The Republicans (presumably later this decade/next decade when they get it together and become a classical party again) will one day hold the Senate majority. Do you not think Mitch Mcconnell is going to have an absolute field-day with this new 1-party power? Just consider it. If we repeal the Filibuster; the moment a Republican gets nominated as majority leader, this country's national policy will immediately shift far-to-mid-Right overnight with no way for a minority (us, in that case) to have our voices heard. 

TL;DR: I'm not saying the Democrats don't stand to gain enormously from the abolishment of the Senate filibuster, but we can't put that toothpaste back in the tube. We (this country) needs the ability for a minority to disrupt process. 

I too am frustrated with these Republican obstructionists, but we **must** hold onto this part of government.

NEW MEXICO DEMOCRATS!,"
From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico%27s_at-large_congressional_district):

&gt;New Mexico did *not* use congressional districts for its representatives to the United States House of Representatives from 1912 to 1969.

&gt;Instead, New Mexico elected its representatives statewide at-large [as a whole].

—————

From 1911–1968, a voter in New Mexico got to pick **three** US Congressmen, who get to vote on [national](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_People_Act) stuff.

In 2021, each voter in New Mexico gets to pick only **one** US Congressmen or Congresswomen... after 1964.

* The same folks who voted for *that* also voted against America’s 1964 Civil Rights Act, which **first** gave minorities and non-whites in New Mexico the right to voter

* The state changed districts virtually overnight after America passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act — which one of our *own* state’s senators voted *against*. 

* Every New Mexico’s voting power was divided by 1/3rd in 1968.

* New Mexico’s DNC is the majority now. We can undue what was *rushed* to do 70 years ago.

* Every New Mexican—white, black, brown—pays for the same stuff, but has **1/3rd** of the representation they had in 1964. Conversely, **2/3rds** of everyone’s vote in NM was stolen back in 1968

* Not to make things awkward for everyone but the folks who did it are only 55–77 years old today — and thought of us as inferior until 1964.

* (They don’t teach *that* at APS. I wonder why?)

———-

If *every* New Mexican’s vote was weakened in 1968 by conservatives dividing the state into three parts, couldn’t it be declared *retroactively* unconstitutional?

Voter ID Laws,"
My trainer, as far as Trumpers go is a pretty nice guy. Today as we were training, he mentioned the MLB moving the All-Star game out of Georgia because of its Voter Laws. He then said “if the MLB doesn’t like Voter ID laws, then they shouldn’t ask for an ID to buy beer.” Other than the fact that’s a massive false equivalency, what would you say to him about the Voter ID laws in particular. It’s easy to argue why a lot of the other laws are racist but it’s hard sometimes to argue that the way the voter ID laws in Georgia are written are racist and designed specifically to keep POC’s from voting.",1,"voter id laws trainer , far trumpers go pretty nice guy . today training , mentioned mlb moving all-star game georgia voter laws . said “ mlb ’ like voter id laws , ’ ask id buy beer. ” fact ’ massive false equivalency , would say voter id laws particular . ’ easy argue lot laws racist ’ hard sometimes argue way voter id laws georgia written racist designed specifically keep poc ’ voting ."

I’m an RN and posted this to a Chauvin thread and got banned.,"I’m a nurse of a decade who had worked both in surgery and emergency. I have given fentanyl in high doses, multiple doses, for over 10 years.

Fentanyl is not an anesthetic (corrected: *primarily an anesthetic). It’s a narcotic pain medication. It can suppress your respiratory drive. Usually we give it in carefully monitored doses (usually in the post-surgery setting) but even then patients can be super sensitive to it. So if you give a patient fentanyl and they tell you they can’t breathe, you immediately check the airway, give oxygen. Administer narcan ASAP if it’s severe enough. I imagine as a first responder who regularly deals with people on this drug, they would know that too? 

Continuing to compress the airway of someone who is losing respiratory drive to fentanyl is 100% NOT what you do. Even if you don’t know what they are on and they tell you that they can’t breathe, you check/assess the patient like it’s real even if you think it’s BS. When I worked in the ED, we had patients all the time saying they were short of breathe or having chest pain and we always took them seriously even if we knew they were probably drug-seeking or just having a panic attack. You never wanna be the person that made the patient wait in the lobby with a chief complaint of shortness of breath that you thought was BS and it turned out to be real. For us, you for sure would get fired for that shit or lose your license. It might be criminal negligence.

Being on a prone (facedown) position already inhibits the lungs and diaphragm the room to expand properly and get air. Then also holding pressure to the neck for 9 mins? I mean, you can’t tell me someone couldn’t have checked a pulse right there? Wasn’t he handcuffed already? It’s really basic CPR. It’s in Basic Life Support (BLS) which I imagine police officers have to take every 2 years like medical professionals since they are first responders?

If he had cardiac arrest somewhere in that 9 mins, you can still potentially bring a patient back if you quickly give high quality CPR and continue to do so until medical help arrives. It’s literally what taking BLS every 2 years is supposed to teach a first responder.",1,"’ rn posted chauvin thread got banned.i ’ nurse decade worked surgery emergency . given fentanyl high doses , multiple doses , 10 years . fentanyl anesthetic ( corrected : *primarily anesthetic ) . ’ narcotic pain medication . suppress respiratory drive . usually give carefully monitored doses ( usually post-surgery setting ) even patients super sensitive . give patient fentanyl tell ’ breathe , immediately check airway , give oxygen . administer narcan asap ’ severe enough . imagine first responder regularly deals people drug , would know ? continuing compress airway someone losing respiratory drive fentanyl 100 % . even ’ know tell ’ breathe , check/assess patient like ’ real even think ’ bs . worked ed , patients time saying short breathe chest pain always took seriously even knew probably drug-seeking panic attack . never wan na person made patient wait lobby chief complaint shortness breath thought bs turned real . us , sure would get fired shit lose license . might criminal negligence . prone ( facedown ) position already inhibits lungs diaphragm room expand properly get air . also holding pressure neck 9 mins ? mean , ’ tell someone ’ checked pulse right ? ’ handcuffed already ? ’ really basic cpr . ’ basic life support ( bls ) imagine police officers take every 2 years like medical professionals since first responders ? cardiac arrest somewhere 9 mins , still potentially bring patient back quickly give high quality cpr continue medical help arrives . ’ literally taking bls every 2 years supposed teach first responder ."

"The Trump campaign reportedly cheated donors who thought they were making a one-time contribution, collecting recurring donations", ,1,"trump campaign reportedly cheated donors thought making one-time contribution , collecting recurring donations"
Trump committed treason and conspired with Qanon for the ONEMILLIONMAGAMARCH.," 

James Madison believed that the ease of communication in small republics was precisely what had allowed hastily formed majorities to oppress minorities. “Extend the sphere of a territory and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other.” Madison assumed that America’s vast geography and large population might stop dangerous factions from mobilizing. But they couldn't have possibly predicted social media and the rate at which disinformation, much of it foreign influenced, will spread.

Hamilton -The Federalist No 68- ""The desire \[of\] foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our counsels"" was a source of corruption and ""one of the most deadly adversaries of republican government.""

Adams shared that concern, discussing such he wrote to Jefferson ""As often as Elections happen the danger of foreign Influence recurs.""

""Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence ... the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government."" - Washington's farewell address.

In late 2019 Val Broeksmit acquired emails belonging to his father, former Deutsche Bank executive William S. Broeksmit who, like another Trump insider -Epstein, took his own life in 2014. Val presented these to the FBI. Shortly later in 2020 we out vis-à-vis Trump's recently released tax returns that he owes $400 million dollars to an undisclosed source. BUT now we know where he owes it.

Trump immediately, and unsuccessfully, tried to sue and silence Broeksmit who testified that the Russian State Bank was underwriting loans, PERSONAL and business, for Trump when Deutsche no longer would due to his previous defaulting on $640 million. Val presented many documents and it appears the Russian state bank had been signing off on Trump's personal loans for years. Putin signs off on loans from the Russian state bank.

Madison - ""Newfangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free government, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other.” For that reason, Madison continued, “the convention have, with great judgment, opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime.”

Definition: In Article III, Section 3 of the United States Constitution, treason is specifically limited to levying war against the US, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\[2\]

Penalty: U.S. Code Title 18: Death,\[8\] or not less than 5 years' imprisonment (minimum fine of $10,000, if not sentenced to death). Any person convicted of treason against the United States will lose the right to hold public office in the United States. \[9\]

The terms used in the definition derive from English legal tradition, specifically the Treason Act 1351. Levying war means --- the assembly of armed people to overthrow of the government or to resist its laws. --- Enemies are subjects of a foreign government that is in open hostility with the United States.\[10\] ----- Those who assemble to levy war, as well as those who conspire with them, can be prosecuted. ----- \[11\] The American definition is narrower than that of English law, which spanned other classes of treason such as counterfeiting and bringing indignity upon the king.\[12\]

Note from above -- Levying war means the assembly of armed people to overthrow of the government or to resist its laws. Those who assemble to levy war, as well as those who conspire with them can be prosecuted.

I personally think that owing hundreds of millions to an enemy nation, one that is openly hostile to the U.S, and has been sending unprecedented numbers bombers over the skies and off the shores of Alaska, makes him a little adherent. If you owed $400 million to a bank that you signed and Putin signed, would you say that's a little sticky?

Aug 18, 2017 Bannon leaves the white house. Oct 28, 2017 he started Qanon. So there really was an insider leaking for a bit, but as a propagandist the seeds he sowed were corrupted. Ron and Jim Watkins took over and just continued to spread lies and by the time the election rolls around in 2020 there's enough members to be a literal FACTION of the US. The group has become volatile and militant, they have been taught by Q that the democrats are evil enemies of the country, and Trump being full in on the thought heist repeats those claims. Trump, by claiming he doesn't know of Q, gives it legitimacy, Q must be telling the truth if he is saying the same things that Trump, the patriot, is saying. By that same association Q lends credibility to Trump because if you trust Q and Trump repeats his ""truths"", then Trump must be a good guy.

Madison, Federalist 10 - ""Among the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction.""  
\- ""By a faction I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.""

The Qanon Faction and right wing militant members/associates want a civil war based on misinformation that was pushed by a Russian asset and foreign ascendant. If Trump had really got the 1million in this first coup, as he requested, then we would no longer be a democratic constitutional republic. Trump will march again, and he's not doing it to MAGA.

Qanon and the MAGA faction have a couple traitorous generals, Michael Flynn and his brother, on their side as well. This is noteworthy because they retain some level of loyalty. His brother, the other Flynn, is the one responsible for delays in sending theNational Guard to help in Washington duiring the riot. Holding back troops, and giving the insurrectionists as much time as possible. He advised that having any guard assist would ""be bad optics.""

“In all very numerous assemblies, of whatever characters composed, passion never fails to wrest the sceptre from reason,” - The federalist #55.

Trump ambiguously gestures Qanon all the time. He wears a Q jersey, Q is the 17th letter. He does Q hand signals, he says Q instead of you, etc. The whole time lying and saying he doesn't know what the movement is. It was all part of a ploy to turn true patriots' love of country into a malignancy, and it worked.

Patriot is a pretty common word, but it's a code-word within Q that's used to address one another. So when Trump announced the march on DC, claiming that it was going to be the biggest most wild march ever, and then said he was calling all PATRIOTS, Trump knew he was calling out to those loyal to him within the violent faction that was waiting. After all they were told to ""sit back and stand by.""",1,"trump committed treason conspired qanon onemillionmagamarch . james madison believed ease communication small republics precisely allowed hastily formed majorities oppress minorities . “ extend sphere territory take greater variety parties interests ; make less probable majority whole common motive invade rights citizens ; common motive exists , difficult feel discover strength , act unison other. ” madison assumed america ’ vast geography large population might stop dangerous factions mobilizing . could n't possibly predicted social media rate disinformation , much foreign influenced , spread . hamilton -the federalist 68- `` desire \ [ of\ ] foreign powers gain improper ascendant counsels '' source corruption `` one deadly adversaries republican government .

"Current Republican ""Strategy""","Now maybe it's me, but the current Republican ""strategy"" of voter suppression laws seems incredibly short-sighted.  Even if you put the overt racism of the laws aside and just look at it from a numbers perspective.  They are alienating an entire block of voters whose numbers continue to rise year to year.  If you think about it there was some serious thought that went into it too, as they first had to have the Supreme Court overturn the Voting Rights Act.  Then zoom out and focus back in on young people.  This demographic has grown up with nothing but mass shootings, and school shooter drills.  The one time the kids rise up and demand common sense gun laws and the Republican held government loses their spine and refuses to do anything.  Add to that the incessant pandering to a white religious minority.

"I had an idea on how to reform the filibuster, without reforming the filibuster.","What if, instead of amending the filibuster, we write a new talking filibuster rule?

Let me explain:

If we write a new rule, and it gets passed, it becomes part of the senate rules. 

Because of that, instead of using the nuclear option to just override Rule 22 and end legislation with a simple majority, which some senators don’t support, we can use it to override rule 22, citing that this new rule says that 41% of the senate must be on the floor for debate to continue. 

This way, we don’t have to amend Rule 22, which requires a supermajority, and it technically follows the rules, so the presiding officer of the senate can’t technically veto it. 

What do you think?

Also btw, I’m 15, so I’m sorry if this is stupid.

[Personal Opinion] The “remove the filibuster” is a double edged sword,"Hello,

I am a younger person who recently has gotten serious about how our country is headed and how it’s going. Let’s jump right into why I think the filibuster’s (potential) removal can be a very damaging thing.

Scenario 1, good ending 

Democrats use reconciliation to pass HR1 or similar methods. This creates the ideal voting scenario and the Democrats break the tradition of the sitting presidents party losing votes and Dems gain more seats in both house and senate and become a filibuster proof majority. Democrats remove the filibuster and are able to pass laws freely and serve the American people without GOP curb stomping any bill like they are today.

Scenario 1.1, alternative good ending 

Democrats use some weird political trickery (Joe Manchin support?) to bypass the filibuster essentially and pass the much needed filibuster-required bills we have. The rest of the scenario plays out like the original.

———————

Scenario 2, the “double edged” bad ending 

This scenario plays out almost identical to scenario 1 and can be used in scenario 1.1. The bad ending comes up in 2024 where in this scenario a red wave comes and takes the House, barely takes Senate, and Presidency. Without a filibuster the GOP goes **scorched earth** and runs rampant and carves a path to never let anyone else win again.*

Hope you enjoyed my little “war games” thoughts, sorry if anything is completely unrealistic or crazy. I’m new to politics and this has been on my mind lately and I wanted to share!

He took the time to discredit Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist who was dismemebered by a hacksaw before he actually died, by Jared Kushner's buddies https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/10/18/florida-rep-matt-gaetz-is-a-terrible-person

He shared a video, with zero context or background, showing a random person handing cash to people in a crowd. He then recklessly questioned if this was another effort from Jewish billionaire George Soros,

Matt Gaetz Voted Against Paid Sick Leave in Florida But Takes Paid Leave From Congress 

In the late 1970s, Matt Gaetz's father co-founded a nonprofit hospice company, Vitas which they sold in 2004, In 2013, the Justice Department sued Vitas, alleging that between 2002 and 2013, the company had defrauded Medicare by filing false claims for services never provided or for patients who weren’t terminally ill. The company settled the case in 2017 for more than $75 million, at the time the largest settlement ever recovered from a hospice company. 

House Speaker Ray Sansom, a friend of Don Gaetz for whom Matt had worked as a legislative aide during law school. In April 2009, Sansom was indicted on corruption charges, accused of tweaking the state budget to funnel more than $25 million to Northwest Florida State College in Niceville. Of those funds, $6 million was earmarked to build a hangar at the Destin airport for a jet company owned by one of Sansom’s friends and donors, real estate developer Jay Odom. Odom was also a client of Matt Gaetz, who handled Odom’s hangar lease. (In 2013, Odom would be sentenced to six months in prison for illegally funneling $23,000 into former Arkansas Gov.

Don Gaetz, routinely wrote articles for the Pensacola News Journal but quit on the grounds that the paper was too mean to his son, Matt Gaetz 

3 months before declaring his candidacy for the state House, he sued Valparaiso on behalf of Okaloosa County and argued publicly that the city’s opposition could sink the F-35 program. In reality, the program couldn’t be reversed without an act of Congress. Gaetz’s lawsuit went nowhere. “It was a big waste of time and money, but it got him in the paper,”

A group of students from the University of West Florida, joining the school’s faculty, are calling on the university’s board of trustees to not choose Florida state Senator Don Gaetz--Matt Gaetz's father. as the institution’s sixth president. 

Where did Matt Gaetz come up with all that money to run for congress? The obvious suspect was his dad.

Three months later, he sold several vacant lots he’d bought years earlier. All of Gaetz’s real estate was purchased by the same buyer: a company called Treveron, which, it turns out, is owned by his dad.

Living Blue In GA,"Listening to people praise the Governor because: 

— “Well him not going into lockdown means we had less deaths unlike Democrat states” 

Me:  Are you saying some deaths are ok as long as it got one over on the Democrats? 

— “Other economy’s are crumbling and ours is thriving” 

Me: GA has nothing outsiders want. People don’t travel to GA for vacation. Ever. They travel for events. (Braves, Foot Ball, Conventions, Colleges) 

Florida only survives on tourism year around. Of course they suffered in the economy.

Could the Georgia voting law be struck down as unconstitutional?,"First, there's the most obviously bullshit provision of this law: Criminalizing the handing out of food and water to those waiting in line to vote. That doesn't even have any rational connection to the pretextual excuse of safeguarding against fraudulent votes. So I wonder if that part of the law could even pass rational basis review, let alone any scrutiny higher than that.

But then there are the other parts of the law, the parts that at least purport on their face to be aimed at detecting and stopping election fraud. While that may be the pretextual excuse, anyone with half a brain can tell that this is just being passed by a Republican-trifecta state in order to keep the democrats out of power. It's clearly just designed to make it logistically impossible for black citizens to vote in large enough numbers that the democrats can pose a threat.

Now, do we have any *proof* (that is to say ... evidence that will hold up in court, not just our common sense as we read the news) that the Georgia Republicans are purposefully and maliciously targeting black voters (as opposed to Democrat voters)? Probably not. However, is it really necessary for us to show said proof? I would argue that, if an election law even so much as has the *disparate impact* of discriminating against black citizens, that alone means it violates the 15th Amendment to the US Constitution.

That's how it works with employment discrimination. For example, in many federal appellate circuits, it is illegal to discriminate against an applicant for employment solely on the basis of their criminal record, because courts have recognized that such a policy has the disparate impact of disproportionately affecting black people, even though the words ""disparate impact"" never appear in the text of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If the words ""disparate impact"" don't appear in the Civil Rights Act but it's still the force of law nonetheless, I see no reason why the same logic can't also be used to incorporate a ""disparate impact"" provision into the 15th Amendment.

So what do you guys think? Will this law likely be struck down as unconstitutional?",1,"could georgia voting law struck unconstitutional ? first , 's obviously bullshit provision law : criminalizing handing food water waiting line vote . n't even rational connection pretextual excuse safeguarding fraudulent votes . wonder part law could even pass rational basis review , let alone scrutiny higher . parts law , parts least purport face aimed detecting stopping election fraud . may pretextual excuse , anyone half brain tell passed republican-trifecta state order keep democrats power .

Am I *really* a Democrat...can you help me?,"I apologize if this isn't the correct sub, and if this is too long or considered a rant. Please feel free to redirect me if this isn't the place to post.

So here goes. I'm a guy in my early 20s who lives in a very red ""Rust Belt"" state in the Midwest. And I would say I've had a very typical childhood experience for someone from here, including political and religious background: I was raised in a pretty socially and religious conservative household. While I have some memories about government from early childhood (like vaguely Bush as President), politics became a much bigger focus of my life with the 2008 election. The actions, cultural issues, and policies of the Obama administration were the center of frequent conversation in my house. They were ""bad"" and ""ruining America"" (in my family's opinion), and being a kid, I mostly accepted this framework and worldview up until my teenage years.

As a young teenager, I began to express disagreement with some of my parents' religious and political views (especially on social issues, which led to shouting more than once). It resulted in frequent arguments, and after a few years of this (in addition to continued exposure to almost exclusively conservative political commentary), I eventually stopped talking about my views. Over the next couple of years (mid to late teens), I feel like I tried to form to ""fit the mold"" of some of my family's political beliefs again. I mostly took in conservative commentary and media through big YouTube boom of more culturally ascendant conservative commentators on the right, which really took off just before the 2016 election.

To make a long story hopefully less long, I voted for Trump (and Republicans down ballot) in 2016 (my first election where I could vote) and 2020. But there were considerations that bothered me privately. Everything from personal conduct, mannerisms, some policies, to the ""fly by the seat of your pants"" attitude of the former administration. And the actions and rhetoric of Republicans at large recently has bothered me too: the hand waving away of investigation relating to the Capitol on January 6th, the unwillingness to be compromising, the attempt to lower trust in America's voting process, the obsession with culture war issues, and even the recent attempts to whittle away at voter's rights. It's frankly frightening.

And recently I feel like I've been lying to myself about my worldview and stances on political issues for a long time. So I've been making an attempt to be more honest with myself and others about my opinions when conversations happen. And I feel embarrassed that I've allowed myself to vote for certain people. But I want to be more educated and go into every election without so much partisan bias without considering what's really for the best of our country. In a lot of ways, I can't consider myself a Republican.

I'm not even entirely sure what I'm asking. I guess do you think I might be a Democrat? Or has anyone here been or is in my position? Or how can I properly educate myself more to figure this out?

Question from a moderate.," Democrat leaders say they care about lgbtq rights and equal rights for women, but they want to go and sign a nuclear deal with iran who impose capital punishment on gay people and also restrict women rights severely. Why should they even make deals with these people? It’s sickening. 

This is coming from a moderate. I voted for joe Biden. Although the Iran nuclear deal is sickening to me. I feel like Democrat leaders want to pretend to stand up for human rights when actually they are supporting regimes that suppress it. How can I as a Jew actively support policies that could possibly lead to the annihilation of my people. For those who say it’s far fetched, we don’t have to look to far in the history books to seen what has happened to the Jewish people.

So back in may, Gavin Newsom implemented a mask mandate, here in California, so then so I started wearing Trump masks to stores (when required) and I started realizing that more and more people have been giving me thumbs up even saying how much they like it (and yes I've gotten dirty looks).  I live in Orange County for context and this used to be a not so conservative county, I couldn't even wear a MAGA hat here without being insulted, but now there's something happening here in California, and it isn't happening in OC, it's happening it other places, there is a red wave happening in California.  We have been told that California is lost but I don't think that's the case (I know there's a lot of Democrats here) but at the same time, Newsom has destroyed our state and caused people to wake up.  I just wanted to share this because if you're not from CA, you wouldn't see what I'm seeing.

Virginia In Play?,"I’m from and live in VA and I think the president has a chance to win Virginia if he campaigns a lot, but not sure because of Northern VA and it’s influence from DC. I think if Trump focuses on the economy, jobs, and the military, he can possibly win.

What do you guys think? I think it’s good that he’s looking at VA as an option Incase he loses a midwestern state. That said, I think the president wins Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, good shot at Nevada so if Trump can continue focusing on his record vs Biden and does really well on election night, I think he’ll do really well on election night.

Yes, there’s the issues with mail in balloting but Democrats are usually the ones more likely to vote by mail this election so if there’s uncertainty over ballots, I feel like it hurts them more than if they just told people from the beginning to just vote in person even if it’s early voting. I think the combination of early voting totals, turnout on election night, how close the states are means we could be able to call the race on election night.

Do Republicans Need Better Marketing?,"So I am a Florida Millennial (late 30s) even if I don't like identifying with many of my fellow millennials. I have been thinking over the last week that it seems the Republicans need to get their marketing into 2020. I started thinking about this after my wife mentioned she never hears any republican ads on the radio and I realized that neither do I, nor do I see any on the streaming TV news.

It is all Democrats all the time. She primarily listens to Spotify and Pandora and I listen to IHeart Radio (for talk stations) and Pandora, all you ever hear are Biden and Pam Keith ads. The same goes for the morning TV news, its constant Biden and Pam Keith ads, now I only watch streaming so maybe on the broadcast news (is that still a thing?) they have Trump or Brian Mast ads.

I did get a mailer from Brian Mast but really who even looks at that stuff, in the recycle bin it goes. So my point is if most people my age and lower are only ever exposed to a constant drivel of Democratic candidate ads who does one expect them to vote for? Why does the Republican party as a whole and the candidates not do a much better job on advertising? Running ads on Pandora or Spotify is not very expensive and since there are a very limited number of ad slots you have a much better chance of the listener actually hearing it.",0,"republicans need better marketing ? florida millennial ( late 30s ) even n't like identifying many fellow millennials . thinking last week seems republicans need get marketing 2020. started thinking wife mentioned never hears republican ads radio realized neither , see streaming tv news . democrats time . primarily listens spotify pandora listen iheart radio ( talk stations ) pandora , ever hear biden pam keith ads . goes morning tv news , constant biden pam keith ads , watch streaming maybe broadcast news ( still thing ? ) trump brian mast ads . get mailer brian mast really even looks stuff , recycle bin goes . point people age lower ever exposed constant drivel democratic candidate ads one expect vote ? republican party whole candidates much better job advertising ? running ads pandora spotify expensive since limited number ad slots much better chance listener actually hearing ."

"I have to point out something. Democrats have made RBG out to be a really, REALLY shitty person.","According to Democrats, RBG's granddaughter said that RBG's dying wish was to have her slot on the Supreme Court filled by a different president.  

Now Democrats are trying to spin the filling of the vacant seat as disrespecting a dying woman's final wish.  

There's a big, **big** problem with that logic, though.  It means RBG was a small, hateful, bigoted woman, an all around shitty person.  

First, it means she is egotistical in the extreme.  She thinks that she has held her seat to such a high standard that president Trump, even if he wins re-election, is unworthy to replace her at all for a full four year term.  That's arrogant. 

Second, it means she is a hateful partisan, **precisely the type of person who should have never held the seat in the first place!**  She hates the Republican president so much that she doesn't think he deserves to appoint justices.  Someone who is that hyperpartisan doesn't belong anywhere near the highest court in the land, and if that's who Democrats hold in such high esteem then Republicans should take every conceivable step to deny them **any** consideration in who fills a judge position at any level.  

Lastly, if these words are true, it is an extremely offensive insult to justices Kavanaugh and justice Gorsuch.  If it offends RBG so much to be nominated by Trump then it follows logically that she must despise his prior two nominees and must believe them to be unworthy as justices.  Again, this is extremely arrogant and hateful.

In their attempts to moralize over this issue, Democrats have unwittingly turned RBG into a pitiful excuse of a human being, an arrogant, hyperpartisan bigot.  Do I think that about RBG?  No.  But more and more people are going to think so if Democrats keep pushing this bullshit story about her dying wish being not to be replaced by Trump.  That turns her whole legacy into a petty, personal, hateful fight with a single president.  Personally, I don't think a woman who served on the highest court longer than any president or any three presidents put together have served is that petty.  

Leftists, once again you have let your anger and blind hatred lead you on a path of wanton destruction.  And this time, it's not just Republicans or the system that you are trying to set ablaze.  It's a 27 year Supreme Court Justice that was on your side.",0,"point something . democrats made rbg really , really shitty person.according democrats , rbg 's granddaughter said rbg 's dying wish slot supreme court filled different president . democrats trying spin filling vacant seat disrespecting dying woman 's final wish .

Today the Republican party is the party of American workers, of people that have struggled, that have worked their way up to a decent standard of living through sacrifice, hard work, tears, blood and sweat. It is the party of the military, the party of the common man, the party of social morality, the party of individual freedom, of decent work and the party of aspiration.

Barbara Lagoa is the justice of now and future Republican party. She was born the child of refugees fleeing communist dictatorship. She was raised in the then industrial town of Hialeah, Florida surrounded by those that escaped communism and who rebuilt their lives in a new land. A town that stood for common sense, hard work and the age old tales of the typical immigrant.

She stood by her community in 2000 when she represented, without charge, Elian Gonzalez and his grandparents against the Communist government of Cuba and the Clinton administration which stole the child in the dark of night from his grandparents and deported him back to a depraved and starved nation.

She has stood by the law as it is written. But more importantly, she knows what it is to fight for what she has, and she knows the struggle of the working people of this country. She is not the child of a millionaire whose word you cannot trust, she is not a professor that was groomed to be where she is today, she is a fighter that has gotten to where she is by her smarts, her fight and her will.

She will not be John Roberts II, she will be Antonin Scalia II. If she is nominated by President Trump she will not only secure the Latino vote throughout the country, she will secure the election of Donald Trump both by her prescence in the Supreme Court and as inspiration and evidence to the voters of this country that the President stands for the legal immigrant and working class of this country.

I urge you to call your representatives and urge them to ask Donald Trump to simply take a meeting with Lagoa. What she will present to him is someone who mirrors him, a fighter, a scrapper who will risk her skin for the common folk of the country and be a reliable, *conservative* Supreme Court Justice.

Thank You,

The black lives matter Movement is the Largest Scale Mass Hysteria Incident in Modern History - In Depth Discussion,"The blm movement is going to be remembered as one of society's largest scale incidents of mass hysteria built on overt lies and hatred. By nature of their support, hundreds of thousands of otherwise good people are socially endorsing the violence that arises from these hateful ""causes"" based on utter fabrications.

**The definition of terrorism: the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.**

Whether you support their cause or not, both blm and antifa as organizations fit the literal definition of terrorism. If you don't call them that yourself, that's fine, until recently neither did the American government, but merely saying that they aren't terrorists because you might think they have a reason for their actions is a subjective opinion on something that is otherwise an objective fact. blm/antifa and their supporters are responsible for a great number of increasingly violent attacks in recent years targeted towards opposing views (namely white people and Trump supporters), where they've earned the ire that's currently directed towards them. It's time we collectively began to address these left-wing extremists for what they truly are.

black lives matter as both an organization and as a ""social statement"" were founded primarily on the basis of ""systemic racism"" and ""police brutality"". Both of which have very little merit outside of left-wing echochambers, with almost all of its messaging crumbling under the slightest bit of scrutiny (if it's supporters ever bothered to scrutinize what they are being indoctrinated by).

""Systemic racism"" is a catch-all term for any and everything to do with race, applied ad hoc to whatever scenarios people would like changed, whether that's in the public and private school systems, our systems of law and the histories of great nations. No legal definition or even standard application of the word has been decided, and everyone has their own variation on what the word means. And yet, [governmental bodies themselves](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ends-critical-race-theory-training-federal-employees) and [people are changing the way we act, talk and think](https://newdiscourses.com/2020/06/reasons-critical-race-theory-terrible-dealing-racism/) in order to combat [this vague THEORY (and I stress that word)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ujq4iAgUMw&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=FreethePeople).

""Police brutality"" has been a term applied to virtually any instance of law enforcement being applied with force (and sometimes even without it), specifically and especially in regards to any crime committed by someone of the black community. Repeated study after study of police shootings has disputed any notion of ""racism"" being a factor in police shootings, and yet the stereotype of ""evil, racist police"" continues to spread. Some studies have even shown the opposite to be true, that white officers are less likely to shoot black suspects, and adjusted for ratios in crime and population white suspects are more likely to be shot by cops (various studies to follow below). And yet, every time a black person is killed by police, regardless of whether or not they were resisting arrest or actively trying to hurt or kill other people, the ""police brutality"" and ""racism"" cards have been pulled to demonize lawful shootings to undermine the faith citizens have in their police and government.

Here are some facts and statistics (or what would probably be considered the real enemy to the blm movement...the truth).

[In American cops make about 10,000,000 arrests a year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191261/number-of-arrests-for-all-offenses-in-the-us-since-1990/). Those ten million arrests don't include detentions, traffic stops or any of the other peaceful public interactions that make up the remaining approximately 60,000,000 police and citizen contact every year. [On average per year, only about 1,000 of those 70 MILLION people interacted with end up dead due to police](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/). Yet, people act like their chances of dying at the hands of a cop are anything but minuscule. The entire blm narrative is built on the foundation of ""police brutality"" and ""racism"" that simply isn't reflected in reality.

We're not even going to begin to discuss how many of those 1,000 people killed by cops each year are armed and dangerous (which is the majority of cases), or how many of them aren’t black (also the majority). It's also important to note that in police reporting ""unarmed"" does not mean ""not violent"". We can even assume, for the sake of argument, that none of those 1,000 police killings each year are justified (even though the vast majority of them are). The ratio of unarmed black men shot and killed (23) in 2018 was 1 out of 67,334 black men arrested. [According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting, there were 686,665 sworn police officers in the United States in 2018](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-74). That’s one unarmed black male shot and killed for every 49,047 sworn police officers. [Out of the nearly 47.8 million black Americans](https://blackdemographics.com/), the police have shot roughly one unarmed black male per roughly 2.1 million people.

[The inevitable conversation that follows is that black people only represent 14% of the US population](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219)**,** how is it that they make up such a high number of overall police deaths\*\*.\*\* blm and it's supporters would like to propagate the idea that it's racism. Which fortunately has little factual basis in this topic. This is where we need to have those brutal, honest conversations that everyone claims to want to have regarding race (silence is violence after all), but nobody is actually allowed to discuss without being banned, canceled or called a racist nazi.

[In the US, the American black population represents 53% of convicted murders, 29% of rapes, 54% of robberies, 33% of assaults, 43% of weapons charges, 29% of domestic abuse and 27% of drug abuse violations among others (continuing to over index in almost all areas of remaining crime)](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43). The vast majority of these crimes were conducted by males, meaning that half of the violent crime in America is committed by less than the roughly 6-7% of black men in the US. It's not only understandable but expected that there would be a higher degree of violence involved in these arrests, as usually the type of person that's being arrested for murder isn't likely to go without a fight, nor would they like to spend their lives in prison. Ignoring these facts is tantamount to delusion.

Almost all studies that conclude that black people are killed disproportionately fail to factor in crime rates into their models, whether on purpose to reach a desired conclusion or via a poor scientific process. Those are very relevant statistics that cannot be ignored when discussing police interactions with black people, nor can they be discarded in studies, as they help to explain why there is a disparity between the black population and arrests/deaths. Many who like to dismiss these figures do so by doing what they always do, and cry ""racism"", whether it's the mere use of these statistics or in the very core of every single arrest that makes up the data.

But simply hand-waving away the reason that there are so many violent interactions between the black community and the police due to ""racism"" is disingenuous and deliberate. The reasons behind those crime rates and why the black community is plagued by crime are extraordinarily complicated, and very well may contain elements of race and racism reaching back decades (such as the Welfare system and Jim Crow laws), but that’s an entirely separate conversation for another day unrelated to the premise of ""police brutality towards blacks"". The fact of the matter is, the black community has and will continue to have problems with overwhelming violence without real intervention, and its these problems that lead to further violent interactions with police.

[Keeping the aforementioned statistics in mind, each year, American cops kill more white people, both in raw numbers and when adjusted for crime rates, than black people](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877) (note: the study has since been retracted due to public inference, however, the data included remains valid, even more studies with similar findings below). Only roughly .009% of all arrests ended with a civilian death regardless of race, and for every 10 deadly weapon assaults on a police officer there was as a result of 1 fatal police shooting, or in other words, even in encounters with deadly weapons police will only fatally shoot about 10% of the time. [In fact, research done by the National Police Research Platform, only roughly 27% of those 680,000+ officers report ever even firing their gun on duty](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/08/a-closer-look-at-police-officers-who-have-fired-their-weapon-on-duty/) (which doesn't specifically entail actually shooting someone either, just the fact that they've shot their weapon). And yet the narrative of blood thirsty police persists.

Contrary to the black lives matter narrative, the police have much more to fear from black males than black males have to fear from the police.[In 2015, black civil-rights commissioner Peter Kirsanow famously defended the police](https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/hans-bader/narrative-racist-police-killings-melts-when-you-know-these-stats) by acknowledging that [a police officer is roughly 18.5x more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer, a number that's been repeated ad nauseam and is roughly supported by statistics year after year (it lowers to roughly 2.5x more likely for a cop to be killed by armed black males than the reverse)](https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2018/topic-pages/officers-feloniously-killed). Factually, black males have made up nearly 50 percent of all cop-killers over the last decade even though they are only 6-7% of the overall population.

White people make up roughly over 50% of known race homicide victims, with caucasians representing roughly 76% of the total US population. Black people were 45% of known race homicide victims, but only 13% of the population. Which means the homicide rate for blacks was 3.5x their percentage of the US population, making them over five times as likely to be homicide victims.

According to a [Bureau of Justice Statistics 2018 study, 15.3% of violent crimes against whites were committed by blacks for a total of 547,948 crimes, with violent black offenders being 1.8x their percent of the population](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv18.pdf). In contrast, whites committed 10.6% of violent crimes against blacks for a total of 59,777 crimes, making up 0.8x their percentage of the population. But of violent crime against black people, 70% of the time the offender was reported by the victim themselves as black, which is supportive of the epidemic of black-on-black violence increasing across the country. The offender to victim ratio shows that violent incidents involving black offenders (22%) was twice the percentage of black victims (11%). 

Hate crime statistics actually show that in recent years, anti-black incidents overall fell to a recent record low share of all hate crime, while anti-white and other races have seen increases in hate crime towards them. [Meanwhile hate crimes committed by black offenders continues to increase year over year, reaching a high of 24% of all reported hate crimes despite making up only 14% of the population](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2018). In major cities such as [New York, black perpetrators make up the majority of hate crimes towards Jewish and LGBT people](https://nypost.com/2019/11/25/what-the-left-doesnt-want-to-mention-about-new-york-city-hate-crimes/), again, despite the narrative that says black people are society's current victims of discrimination.

People need to stop acting like, just because they’re black, they’ll die if they interact with the cops or that white people are targeting black people with racism and hatred. Of course in a country of hundreds of millions of people there is going to be anti-black racism. But it certainly isn't to the degree in which activists like to perpetuate, [such as it being a public health crisis](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/health/states-racism-public-health-crisis-trnd/index.html). Statistics simply do not reflect any reality in which this absurdity is true, unless a concentrated effort is put into disqualifying and discounting data that opposes the narrative. If anything, the crime data, statistics on police shootings and the general modern societal zeitgeist would suggest an active and ongoing discrimination against whites. But hey, that's another topic for another day isn't it.

The questions that decent human beings need to seriously ask themselves in regards to police is, are you committing crimes? Are you going to resist if the cops try to arrest you? I would hope not for both of those questions. In 2020, there's no excuse for that level of ignorance. Therefore, your chances of dying at the hands of the police are virtually zero. But, the best part is, even if you are committing crimes and resisting arrest, your chances of dying at the hands of the police are still virtually zero, regardless of your skin color or particular demographic.That's the statistical fact. No matter how many slogans are chanted or how many times ACAB is gratified onto buildings, it doesn't suddenly mean the police are out to kill anyone.

The gaslighting from the media and the blm supporters claim that the violent actions of a ""few"" rioters do not represent most of the ""peaceful group"" (a courtesy not extended to the legitimately mostly peaceful police). [The left-leaning Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project reports that in the summer of 2020 alone (not including the continued riots in September) there were 7,750+ demonstrations related to blm](https://acleddata.com/2020/09/03/demonstrations-political-violence-in-america-new-data-for-summer-2020/). Of those, over 1000 included some sort of assault on police and/or bystanders, arson or looting but yet were not declared riots.

Over 570 of those ""peaceful protests"" in 220 locations turned violent to the degree that they were declared riots. That's 570+ ""mostly peaceful protests"" barely covered by mainstream news, that seemingly most supporters of blm refuse to acknowledge even occurred, which included an [estimated $2 billion dollars in damages (most of which isn't covered by insurance, done to local family businesses, many black owned)](https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2020/07/06/298012.htm), along with a few dozen related fatalities (including targeted, accidental and incidental, more to follow below) and countless incidents of arson, looting and assault against bystanders and police. ACLED also stated that of those demonstrations, only 5% of them have been met with force by police, which is obviously roughly the same percentage of ""protests"" that become violent riots.

Only of course the media and blm supporters would like you to believe that police (by way of ""fascist"" Trump) are arresting and attacking ""peaceful protesters utilizing their 'freedom of speech'"", which couldn't be further from the truth. The freedom of speech was designed to protect people from those who think violence is the solution to democratic problems. [Inciting violence was written in as an exception to the amendment, in part so that people couldn't use strength against others to assert beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imminent_lawless_action). There's legal and historical precedence for proper ""freedom of speech"" and ""freedom to protest"", and nobody should care about the personal interpretations of rioters and terrorists on those fundamental freedoms.

And yet here we are, in a society where the mainstream media, an extraordinarily vocal minority of citizens, [multinational billion dollar businesses donating hundreds of millions to the cause](https://conservativefiringline.com/list-of-269-companies-supporting-antifa-black-lives-matter/) that [partially goes to fund rioters' bail from jail after arrests](https://trendingpolitics.com/here-is-the-list-of-celebrities-paying-bail-for-violent-rioters-and-looters/) ([multiple criminals who](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/09/portland-rioter-arrested-double-murder-one-week-portland-officials-let-off-interfering-police-downtown-protest/) then went on to [commit other murders](https://hotair.com/archives/jazz-shaw/2020/09/12/chicago-gun-store-looter-released-murders-walgreens-clerk/)), celebrities and sports teams are all siding with blm over blatantly false lies and misinformation. All the while supporting the notion that black people are being ""oppressed and victimized"". None of their opinions on equality, inclusive ideologies and the freedom of speech, actually extends to the mostly peaceful police officers, towards white people, or any other demographic that condemns these actions ([such as the increasing number of liberals leaving the party #WalkAway,](https://www.walkawaycampaign.com/) or the [various minority groups now increasingly supporting Trump](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/514174-poll-trump-approval-rises-among-black-hispanic-voters)). People need to forgo emotional arguments for rational analysis, stop confusing correlation with causation, and understand the impact of confounding variables and their own bias in these discussions.

Because what is happening is society and the Regressive Left is fostering an environment based on hate in the name of acceptance, including the willful return of [Segregation](https://pjmedia.com/columns/matt-margolis/2019/06/24/democrats-were-the-party-of-segregation-years-ago-and-they-still-are-today-n120433), [Affirmative Action](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/06/24/california-legislature-repeals-proposition-209-places-race-based-affirmative-action-on-ballot/) and identity politics based on race, the demand for reparations ([despite the Welfare system predominately geared towards blacks, having spent $22 TRILLION in the past 50 years towards poverty, costing 3 times as much as all of America's wars since the Revolution](https://www.heritage.org/poverty-and-inequality/report/the-war-poverty-after-50-years)), special considerations in academia (like [lowered admission standards or testing requirements](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/06/07/fairness-means-lowering-bar-education-column/673198002/), even though [more money is spent on additional education funding for black students than any other race](https://www.heritage.org/education/report/the-myth-racial-disparities-public-school-funding)**,** and [racial quotas hurting Asian Americans](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-affirmative-action-and-asian-americans)), the desire to rid society of capitalism ([while hypocritically selling copious amounts of branded merchandise](https://store.blacklivesmatter.com/store/)), [two parent households](https://www.dailywire.com/news/black-lives-matter-what-we-believe-page-disrupt-the-western-prescribed-nuclear-family-dismantle-cisgender-privilege) (which has now quietly been removed due to criticism) and the [abolishment of police and prisons](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/07/17/black-lives-matter-activist). [Democrats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eQzLcO5qhY&ab_channel=HarveyC) and [blm leaders](https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/blm-leader-if-change-doesnt-happen-we-will-burn-down-this-system/) have continually called for public violence, including [attacks on police](https://twitter.com/BrendonLeslie/status/1299896694088388609) and [white folks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxwueUxE-8c&ab_channel=SmoothMedia), with the [demonization of white people](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1610610/smithsonian-aspects-white-culture.webp?w=790&f=ab12077631acab2dac02fd587b3f4f15) as a [sub-human race](https://quillette.com/2018/07/13/the-rise-and-decline-of-black-lives-matter-a-toronto-case-study/) and [as racist demons](https://www.redstate.com/mike_miller/2020/09/08/ever-seen-a-woke-instructor-teach-a-roomful-of-white-people-theyre-racist-sub-human-demons-here-ya-go.../).

Compound this with the contrasting fact that [nearly 80% of the black community not only disagrees with the notion of defunding the police, but a significant portion would like to see either the same amount or more police presence in their neighborhoods](https://news.gallup.com/poll/316571/black-americans-police-retain-local-presence.aspx). As anyone who grew up in a crime ridden black community knows (such as myself), a lack of policing only hurts the people that [soft-bellied liberals claim to want to help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv5-mc4U_Zw&ab_channel=TheDailyWire). If any of the organizations and rioters actually cared about black lives mattering, then they would be focusing on the real tragedies occurring within their own communities. Such as the uncontrolled black-on-black violence, drug use and absentee fathers, and not whatever viral case makes the news in order to further the political agenda. [The black community that actually deals with the rampant violence and gangs realize that defunding police is tantamount to forfeiting their lives and the lives of loved ones](https://www.chicagotribune.com/data/ct-shooting-victims-map-charts-htmlstory.html).

If the two tenants of the blm and antifa supporters are based on ""systemic racism"" and ""police brutality"" and both are built on misinformation and lies, then what are all of the riots, looting, arson and murder actually for? Why as a society have we both allowed and endorsed these horrific actions to the point of normalcy? Why is it so difficult for liberals to disavow the actual closest things our generation has seen to Nazism?

[Why does the violence inspired by the ""blm cause"" not count as extremism other than social bias of the people who believe in it](https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/07/how_the_left_creates_fake_studies_to_fabricate_rightwing_terrorism.html) (despite glaringly obvious examples that say otherwise)? Defenders would like to argue that just because these killers and anarchists believed in the blm narrative, doesn't mean they have killed all those cops or Trump supporters specifically for blm. And just because people aren't card carrying members of antifa, then obviously they aren't rioting specifically for antifa...it's all just a magical coincidence that they buy their branded t-shirts and wave their affiliated flags.

But yet, if an individual police officer happens to kill a black man in the line of duty, that's somehow representative of all officers and ""systemic racism"" according to these same groups. We wouldn't excuse this type of behavior if it had been done in the name of ISIS. We wouldn't judge an act of terrorism on whether or not it's followers actually traveled to Syria before stabbing someone in the throat. Like logical, intelligent human beings we would determine their guilt via their extremist beliefs and horrific actions, which at this point is undeniable despite the feverish attempts to deny virtually all of it (a relatively small list compared to all incidents of blm and antifa inspired attacks to follow).

When we have such divergent attitudes in the way the very cultures and people of various races approach life, are we still feigning surprise that there's a difference in terms of wealth, crime, education, economic or job status between races? Eventually we need to be honest and look at how people actually behave and how society functions, instead of playing pretend and arguing about microagressions and white fragility.

Allowing this toxic blm rhetoric continue in this state for political reasons is entirely the opposite of being respectful of other views and is a direct attack on democracy. The sheer unfathomable damage done for this ""cause"" will go down in history as one of the worst decisions our society has ever inflicted upon itself perpetuated by the willful ideological delusion of one political side and its ever increasingly unstable base. If there are any blm supporters still reading this, I implore you to reconsider your stance. You can be against racism and support the real black community without endorsing the hate and lies of the blm organization. There is no requirement to martyr violent criminals just because they died while being black.

Please. If you're honestly trying to do what's best for society and the real black families adversely affected, ensure you're not on the wrong side of history while doing it.

Edit: Please feel free to copy and paste this information where you see fit, I know not everyone interested in these conversations wants to do the leg-work and a lot of the discussions revert back to the same topics (crime rates, demographics, studies, etc). And rather than ""own"" a stupid Reddit post, I would rather see more people discussing the realities of this situation with the most concrete information.

\*\*\*\*

[2019 Study from Michigan State University and the University of Maryland via the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877) concluded: ""We find no evidence of anti-Black or anti-Hispanic disparities across shootings, and White officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-White officers. Instead, race-specific crime strongly predicts civilian race. This suggests that increasing diversity among officers by itself is unlikely to reduce racial disparity in police shootings"" and ""Examination of National Violent Death Reporting System data shows racial differences across types of fatal shootings. Black civilians fatally shot by police (relative to White civilians) are more likely to be unarmed and less likely to pose an immediate threat to officers. In contrast, White civilians (relative to Black civilians) are nearly three times more likely to be fatally shot by police when the incident is related to mental-health concerns and are seven times more likely to commit 'suicide by cop'"".

[Bonus points: the Vice President of Research & Innovation at Michigan](https://www.thecollegefix.com/scholar-forced-to-resign-over-study-that-found-police-shootings-not-biased-against-blacks/) was forced to resign partially due to his contrary findings that stated there was no racism in police shootings, which was among his other ""racist science"" that some faculty and students found offensive.

[2018 Study from Michigan State and Arizona State University concluded](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550618775108): ""When adjusting for crime, we find no systematic evidence of anti-Black disparities in fatal shootings, fatal shootings of unarmed citizens, or fatal shootings involving misidentification of harmless objects. Multiverse analyses showed only one significant anti-Black disparity of 144 possible tests. Exposure to police given crime rate differences likely accounts for the higher per capita rate of fatal police shootings for Blacks, at least when analyzing all shootings. For unarmed shootings or misidentification shootings, data are too uncertain to be conclusive.""

[2016 Study from Washington State University via American Society of Criminology concluded](https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/208/2016/08/Police-Reverse-Racism-Effect_-James_James-_Vila-2016-Criminology__Public_Policy.pdf): ""We found that, despite clear evidence of implicit bias against Black suspects, officers were slower to shoot armed Black suspects than armed White suspects, and they were less likely to shoot unarmed Black suspects than unarmed White suspects. These findings challenge the assumption that implicit racial bias affects police behavior in deadly encounters with Black suspects.""

[2016 Study from Harvard via the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22399): ""On the most extreme use of force – officer-involved shootings – we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account. We argue that the patterns in the data are consistent with a model in which police officers are utility maximizers, a fraction of which have a preference for discrimination, who incur relatively high expected costs of officer-involved shootings.""

[2018 Follow-up Study from Harvard via the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24238): ""In stark contrast, Fryer (forthcoming) finds that, conditional on a police interaction, there are no racial differences in OIS on either the extensive or intensive margins. Using data from Houston, Texas – where I have both OIS and a randomly chosen set of interactions with police where lethal force may have been justified but was not used – I find, after controlling for suspect demographics, officer demographics, encounter characteristics, suspect weapon and year fixed effects, that blacks are 27.4 percent less likely to be shot at by police relative to non-black, non-Hispanics. Investigating the intensive margin – who shoots first in an encounter with police or how many bullets were discharged in the endeavor – there are no detectable racial differences.""

[2018 Study from Rutgars University and Kookmin University and Purdue College concluded](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325874094_Do_White_Law_Enforcement_Officers_Target_Minority_Suspects): ""This article aims to answer this question: are white police officers more likely to use lethal force on minority suspects or people of a specific race? To answer this question, the authors construct a data set of all confirmed uses of lethal force by police officers in the United States in 2014 and 2015. They find that although minority suspects are disproportionately killed by police, white officers appear to be no more likely to use lethal force against minorities than nonwhite officers""

[2016 Study from the Pacific Institute of Research and Evaluation, Curtin University, University of Columbia found](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/23/1/27): ""On average, an estimated 34 people were killed or medically treated for injury by law enforcement per 10 000 stops/arrests. That ratio is surprisingly consistent by race/ethnicity. Blacks have high arrest and stop rates, and per capita are much more likely than whites to die at the hands of police. However, when blacks are stopped or arrested, they are no more likely than whites to be injured or die during that incident.Consistent with our findings, simulation studies find police are no more likely to fire on unarmed blacks than unarmed whites, and high rates of black speeding citations per capita result from high violation rates. A systematic review identified 10 studies that found suspect race/ethnicity did not predict use of force or its escalation. However, one study found blacks were more likely than whites to face force during compliance checks. The PPCS survey also found that blacks were more likely to experience physical force and to perceive the threat of force during a stop, although few respondents actually were injured by the force applied. The large majority of incidents that those stopped perceived as undue force was stops where officers shouted at or threatened people, presumably to deter resistance.""",0,"black lives matter movement largest scale mass hysteria incident modern history - depth discussionthe blm movement going remembered one society 's largest scale incidents mass hysteria built overt lies hatred . nature support , hundreds thousands otherwise good people socially endorsing violence arises hateful `` causes '' based utter fabrications . **the definition terrorism : use violence threats intimidate coerce , especially political purposes . ** whether support cause , blm antifa organizations fit literal definition terrorism . n't call , 's fine , recently neither american government , merely saying n't terrorists might think reason actions subjective opinion something otherwise objective fact . blm/antifa supporters responsible great number increasingly violent attacks recent years targeted towards opposing views ( namely white people trump supporters ) , 've earned ire 's currently directed towards .

Hidin' Biden,"Hey, everybody, I wanted to get anybody's opinions on the different campaign strategies that Trump and Biden are implementing. Trump is holding outdoor rallies where masks are recommended, but not required. Most people are wearing masks based on the rallies I have seen so far. It looks like Trump is going to travel to all of the battleground states. Trump is readily available to take questions from the (often times hostile) press, as he's always been. He is even willing to debate Biden on Joe Rogan's podcast. The energy is high at his rallies. It reminds me so much of the 2016 campaign. 

On the other hand, I am shocked at what I have seen from the other side. Biden has stated that he won't have any rallies. He's had limited exposure in which he speaks in front of a tiny audience. He hasn't really been to many places. He has shirked questions from the media, even putting a ""press lid"" Saturday morning after Ginsburg died when he probably should have taken the opportunity to get out to DC and drum up support. Whenever Biden talks, he sounds so incoherent and, as Trump would say, ""low energy."" I just haven't seen anything really from their campaign that's exciting that would make the swing independent voter think ""this man wants to be the Commander in Chief.""

I know that these are crazy times that we are living in with COVID, but man, I am really shocked at what I am seeing from the Dems. It's almost as if they think they have the election in the bag based on polling numbers (which I don't trust or take seriously). But if Trump is out there with high energy talking to people, doesn't that show how much he wants to remain President?  

I just want to gauge peoples' opinions about the campaign strategies. Who do you think has the better strategy? Is it smarter for Trump to hold outdoor rallies so he can actually campaign and show that lie should go on despite the pandemic? Or is it smarter for the Biden campaign to bunker down to show how much they have taken COVID seriously?

Longtime D voting R this year,"As I reminded myself this is the same media from 2001 that convinced their own people it was okay to bomb and completely destabilize the Middle East “because they had ISIS”, I decided to open my mind.

I attended BOTH rallies, Trump’s and Biden’s and needless to say, my mind was blown when I went to Trump’s. I never experienced such a magnitude of patriotism and unity. Numerous black people and other POCs were there, the majority of mainstream news would never show that. They looked happy and they were being treated equally from what I saw. People didn’t even treat them like black people, they were regular people like all other people. The primary message of the rally was to make our country better and the vibes were nothing but positive and energetic. In comparison, Biden’s rally was all about why Trump is a bad president and the energy was absolutely negative. People were angry and bitter, looking as if they were ready to beat up whoever expressed their support for Trump. This opened my eyes and made me realize where the hatred is truly coming from. As a longtime Democrat, I will be voting for Trump. We must start improving our country through unity, love, and positivity, which is completely opposite from what Democrats want at the moment.

Edit 1: clarification: what I mean by “People didn’t treat them like black people” is that they did not intentionally sympathize and treat them like victims just because they were black. They treated them like all other people regardless of the skin color. Sorry, English isn’t my first language and the wording could have been better.

Edit 2: thank you so much for all the awards! Never had an award before. :) This kind of outcome is not what I expected, let’s continue to stay united!

Edit 3: if you reported this post or feel the need to report, I strongly encourage you to open your mind and attend BOTH events instead of having all your thoughts formed by the mainstream news. Ability to keep your mind open and listen to both sides through unbiased lens is an extremely vital skill to have nowadays. If you still don’t agree with me, I still love you and will never treat you differently solely because of your political stance.

Let me know if you find the answer to this question..., ,0,let know find answer question ...
The real truth about Trump,"Real Coffee with Scott Adams is worth listening to regularly because Adams, like Trump, is an out-of-the-box thinker.  During one of his recent shows, Adams framed Trump uniquely and insightfully.  According to Adams, while Trump may falter on smaller decisions (why, oh why, did he waste time talking to Woodward?), his gift is his ability to do the impossible.  In other words, when everyone says something can't be done, Trump's response is a version of ""here, hold my beer"" (or, as he's a teetotaler, ""hold my soda"").  Tell Trump something's impossible, and he goes and makes it possible.

I was not on Team Trump in the beginning.  What changed my mind was having a New York friend tell me, ""Trump gets things done that no one else can.""  The example she gave me, something about which I was ignorant since I'm not a New Yorker, was Trump and the Wollman Skating Rink.

The rink was a city-owned property that had fallen into disrepair during the 1970s.  By 1980, the city was planning to refurbish, a project it said would take two years.  Six years and $13 million later, the work already done was wrong, and the city announced that it had to start over.  In May 1986, Trump, then 39, told Mayor Ed Koch that if the mayor handed the project to him, Trump would have the rink ready by Christmas for less than $3 million, none of which would be a profit to Trump.

As it happened, Trump did not do what he had promised.  Instead, he did the impossible by hugely exceeding expectations.  Trump finished the job in four months and came in 25% under budget.  According to my friend, New Yorkers understood that if Trump undertook a task, he'd do it, and do it well.  He would achieve the impossible.

Remember how Barack Obama, during the campaign, talked down Trump's promise to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and improve the economy?  Obama could not have been more snide or dismissive:

""Well, how exactly are you going to do that? What exactly are you going to do? There's no answer to it,"" Obama said.

""He just says, 'Well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.' Well, what, how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.""

Trump said, ""Hold my soda,"" and, until the Democrats took a hacksaw to the economy with their Wuhan virus overreach, Trump waved his magic wand all over the economy.  By July 2019, Forbes was reporting:

In the last 30 months of President Obama's term, manufacturing employment grew by 185,000 or 1.5%. In President Trump's first 30 months, manufacturers added 499,000 jobs, expanding by 4.0%. In the same 30-month time span during the mature, post-recovery phase of the business cycle, some 314,000 more manufacturing jobs were added under Trump than under Obama, a 170% advantage.

We were told that the sluggish economic growth rate that Obama oversaw was the new normal.  Trump said, ""Hold my soda,"" and, by September 2019, before the lockdown tried to end the party, Trump had the economy chugging along at rates unseen in decades: incomes, especially in the lower brackets, increased at 3.4% annually; poverty declined to 11.8%; unemployment dropped to the lowest in decades, with the most significant benefits flowing to minorities and women; and the number of families in the lowest economic bracket dropped by 1%.

Everyone predicted dire outcomes if Trump moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.  Trump said, ""Hold my soda,"" moved the embassy...and that proceeded so well that he also announced that Israel has sovereignty over the Golan Heights.

And everyone said there could be no peace in the Middle East.  After all, if Obama couldn't make that miracle happen (and, instead, oversaw ISIS's rise, an Egyptian fundamentalist revival, the Syrian civil war, and Libya's collapse), then Trump definitely couldn't bring about peace.  Again, Trump said, ""Hold my soda"" and began getting the Sunni nations, one after another, to normalize relations with Israel.

Trump did this with a new paradigm that cut the Palestinians out of the loop and sold the Sunnis on the wonders of peace and prosperity with Israel as an ally, not an enemy.  The UAE and Bahrain are on board, and Trump promises — and it's reasonable to believe — that all the Sunni nations will follow.

And so will end 72 years of alternately hot and cold, but always hostile, relations between Israel and her neighbors.  The UAE is changing its schools' curricula to support Israel, and Saudi's imam of the Grand Mosque demands that Muslims treat Jews well.  It's big; it's real; and for Trump, it wasn't impossible.

I'll end with an optimistic poem that Edgar Albert Guest wrote early in the 20th century.  It seems appropriate here:

It Couldn't Be Done

Somebody said that it couldn't be done

      But he with a chuckle replied

That ""maybe it couldn't,"" but he would be one

      Who wouldn't say so till he'd tried.

So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin

      On his face. If he worried he hid it.

He started to sing as he tackled the thing

      That couldn't be done, and he did it!

 

Somebody scoffed: ""Oh, you'll never do that;

      At least no one ever has done it;""

But he took off his coat and he took off his hat

      And the first thing we knew he'd begun it.

With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,

      Without any doubting or quiddit,

He started to sing as he tackled the thing

      That couldn't be done, and he did it.

 

There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,

      There are thousands to prophesy failure,

There are thousands to point out to you one by one,

      The dangers that wait to assail you.

But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,

      Just take off your coat and go to it;

Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing

"If you are a smug Democrat or leftist coming here to see how ""stupid"" we are...","- Trump is trying to encourage peace in the world.  He's making moves to end the wars we are in.  

**Democrats have brought the violence here to our streets.  They are failing to condemn it and normalizing the idea that even more will happen if they don't get what they want.**

- You tell us Black Lives Matter is just about better police treatment of black people.

**Trump doesn't control the police, so why were people trying to storm the White House?**

- It's just about ""unfair treatment"".

**Why do you all ignore the ACTUAL justice reform that Trump signed?**

 - You think we care nothing about people's lives.

**But you don't say anything about states that passed bills making it legal to abort a child literally as it's being born.**

 - You think we are selfish for wanting to go to church.

**How many crowded funerals did George Floyd get, again?**

 - You chose Biden and try to sell him as a reasonable centrist.

**We know that he may have been that 20 years ago, but he's changed his agenda to be far more ""progressive.""**

 - You call us fear-mongers when we point out that the Democrats have gone a lot further left.

**Bernie and AOC have both said that the far left side of the Democrat party will be able to move Biden even FURTHER left.**

 - You tell us we're ""selfish, greedy bastards.""

**Republicans give more than Democrats do to charity, and do so at all levels of income.**



 - You say that Trump is going to have roaming bands of Nazi brownshirts on the streets terrorizing people.

**You are now gathering to harass diners trying to eat meals outside...demanding they raise their fists, political figures trying to have dinner are being accosted, conservative journalists have had to move from their homes, you are shouting death threats outside the Senate Majority leader's house and now BLM apparently has a group targeting racist ""citizens"" to show up at their homes...**

 - You say that WE are ""in a cult"".

**You have most major media giving you talking points that you agree with and you discuss how you've had to cut actual family and friends out of your life because they like ""Mango Mussolini"".**

 - You say that you are the ones who love minorities.

**The vitriol that you express towards any member of a minority group that champions conservative beliefs is testimony that you do not.**

 - You say that taking our kids to church is child abuse because they are impressionable.

**But when kids are taken to riots by antifa parents and tear gas is deployed, it's the cops' fault for endangering the kids.**

 - You say that you love America.

**You voted for a dude that wanted it fundamentally transformed...you say that ""it was never great"" and some of you are openly wanting a socialist state and you are burning American flags in the streets now.**

 - Teachers are concerned that ""conservative parents"" might overhear the lessons they are teaching our kids.

**You think they have a right to be scared of the parents who are paying their salaries.**

 - You snidely said, ""All buildings matter"" on 9/11.

**BLM Riots Are Officially the Most Costly Man made Damage to American Property in History**

 - You think you are the ones who understand civics.

**You still insist that Hillary *really* won the 2016 election.**

 - You used to deny being socialists.

**Now you often try to make self-posts here asking us, ""What's wrong with having socialism?""**

 - You think that kids making MAGA videos is wrong and exploitative.

**But at the same age it's okay for other kids to do dancing in drag at strip clubs.**

 - You say that we need to have tough conversations about controversial issues.

**But if we have those conversations, you demand that we agree with you or we are accused of engaging in hateful speech.**

 - You demand that subreddits that seem to encourage violence and are conservative be ""shut down"".

**You defend subreddits that advocate violence from the side that is currently PERPETRATING violence in the streets.**

 - You complained when re open protests had armed people at them.

**A member of a black militia actually opened fire accidentally at a BLM protest and shot three comrades in Louisville.  We never hear about it.**

 - You think we're poorly informed due to the terrible media we consume.

**You still don't know the true story of what happened to the Covington kids in DC and you still want Nick Sandmann to suffer for that hate-smirk.**

 - You think that Russia somehow nefariously influenced the last election via social media.

**But you never question who might be behind your favorite left-wing social media sites and posts.**

 - Trump has increased troop pay, improved military readiness, invested in support and worked for REAL reform for a VA long beleaguered by problems.

**You tried to float the idea that Trump hates the troops.**

 - When people say that they are scared to put up a sign supporting the President, many of you say, ""Good... you should be scared.""

**You demand your right to espouse WHATEVER political beliefs you want to, even if you are a commie who wants gulags and if we object, it's McCarthyism.**

 - You said it was grossly offensive, horrible, awful and racist to blame the virus on China.

**But every day you slog on trying to blame the virus on Trump.**

 - You complain at how the virus is decimating the economy.

**But you don't care that the House won't get together with the Senate to cooperate on a Covid relief bill.**

 - You think it's too dangerous to vote in person.

**But you think these protests just *have to happen* because the cause is too important.**

 - You berate conservatives when you see them posting on other subreddits.

**But you get mad when you come here to berate us and you get banned for it.**

 - You think that white people are clueless and pretty racist and generally kinda bad and responsible for most of the suffering in the world.

**But you want us to adopt the Nordic model of healthcare.**

 - You are LGBTQ+ - supportive!

**... but when 45% of gay men say that they are backing Trump...SUDDENLY they are ""immoral.""**

 - You've spent years blaming anti-vaxx on ""the right.""

**But when Biden and Harris suggested that they wouldn't trust a Covid 19 vaccine because Trump is President, you were silent.  They lied, people died?**

 - You keep insisting that the USA is the worst nation at dealing with Covid...

**Per population, seven other countries have done ""worse""...they are Belgium, the UK, Spain, Peru, Italy, Sweden and Chile.**

 - You seem to oppose any measure that would make our vote more secure and less prone to fraud.  You insist that fraud doesn't happen.

**But you are yelling that somehow Republicans are going to steal the election via some nebulous voter fraud.**

 - It's called ""redistricting"" when you Democrats make voting districts.  You say that it's fixing longstanding problems of representation in populations.

**If the Republicans do the same you scream that it's ""gerrymandering that is ruining democracy.""**

 - You think that our only objections to Obama were mustard and that tan suit.  And only because we are racist.

**IRS scandal, unconstitutional DACA, health reform disaster, Fast and Furious, disappearing stimulus money, spying on journalists and persecuting Fox, Iran pallets of cash, incoherent Middle East policy...to name a few...**

 - You suddenly think you need guns because Trump is ""worse than Hitler"" and you might need to protect yourself from the government.

**You are going to vote for a man who just tweeted that he's going to take the guns.**

 - You think it's cute that Joe Biden played ""Despacito"" on his phone to win over Latino voters.

**Latino voters know that the lyrics to that song are:** 

**Slowly**

**I want to breathe in your neck slowly**

**Let me murmur things in your ear**

**So that you remember if you’re not with me**

**Slowly**

**I want to undress you in kisses slowly**

**Firmly in the walls of your labyrinth**

**And of your body, I want to create a manuscript**

#Mostly folks, you know ... we've NOTICED.

We have noticed these things.  

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

"My Problem with r/Politics, and Why I’m Republican","I’m sure someone has said something about this before, but here is my opinion, why I am now a Republican, and why I will never associate politically with people who are Democrats.

My first problem is with r/Politics. I’ve slowly comes to realize it is literally all democrats. This alone isn’t a problem - the problem is they delete and attack anybody who is Pro-Trump, or Republican in general. You are not allowed to post things like Biden’s VP pick calling him a pedophile, or anything bad about her since she is an African American woman.

Why am I now Republican? I’ll be honest, I voted blue in 2016. I’ve never had a president who was upfront and brutally honest. I never knew about ‘fake media’, I was simply just brainwashed into thinking ‘orange man bad’. Over the years I’ve come to realize I feel like I have more freedom and opportunities. Trump has lowered taxes, cap rates, and has overall increased my wealth substantially in 4 years. He’s denuclearized one of the most deadly places, killed an extremely dangerous Islamic state leader, and so much more thats made me start doing my own research about him instead of coming home, listening to CNN for dinner, and going to sleep. 

Now finally, why I won’t associate politically with people who are democrats. The first incident happened when one of my black friends openly stated he didn’t support BLM because they do nothing about people in Chicago. He was then attacked ruthlessly, people called him “white-washed”, and all sorts of crap like that. He was attacked for being an African American with an opinion, and BLM supporters / Democrats would not accept that. The next incident happened to my Asian American girl that was my friend.

Democrats & Jim Crow: A Century of Racist History the Democratic Party Prefers You'd Forget,"&#x200B;

In the last Presidential election, Donald Trump was lauded for his performance among black voters – he scored 4 percent of female black voters and a whopping 13 percent of black male voters, the highest since Richard Nixon. This isn’t shocking. Black voters have voted en masse for the Democratic Party since the mid-60s and the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and the social welfare programs of the Great Society. This solidified black voters behind the Democratic Party, but they had been moving there since the New Deal.

However, it’s a historical anomaly in the United States. The traditional home of the black voter was the Republican Party, due to its historical role in ending slavery and introducing Reconstruction Acts and Amendments to the Constitution. It also did not help that the Democratic Party was the party of Jim Crow, a system of legally enforced segregation present throughout the American South in the aftermath of the Civil War.

**What Do We Mean When We Say “Jim Crow?”**

Before delving further into the topic, it is important to define precisely what we mean by Jim Crow and why it is a distinct form of legal codes in United States history. While Northern and Western cities were by no means integrated, this integration was de facto, not de jure. In many cases, the discrimination in the North was a discrimination of custom and preference, discrimination that could not be removed without a highly intrusive government action ensuring equality of outcome. Northerners and Westerners were not required to discriminate, but nor were they forbidden from doing so.

Compare this to the series of laws in the American South known for mandating segregation at everything from public schools to water fountains.

No one is entirely sure where the term “Jim Crow” came from, but it’s suspected that it comes from an old minstrel show song and dance routine called “Jump Jim Crow.” Curiously, the first political application of the term “Jim Crow” was applied to the white populist supporters of President Andrew Jackson. The history of the Jim Crow phenomenon we are discussing here goes back to the end of Reconstruction in the United States.

**The Reconstruction Era**

Briefly, Reconstruction was the means by which the federal government reasserted control over the Southern states that had previously seceded to form the Confederate States of America. This involved military occupation and the disenfranchisement of the bulk of the white population of the states. The results of the Reconstruction Era were mixed. Ultimately, Reconstruction ended as part of a bargain to put President Rutherford B. Hayes into the White House after the 1876 election. The lasting results of Reconstruction are best enumerated for our purposes as the Reconstruction Amendments:

• The 13th Amendment abolished involuntary servitude for anyone other than criminals. It was once voted down and passed only through the extensive political maneuvering on behalf of President Abraham Lincoln himself and the approval of dubious Reconstruction state governments in the South. It became law in December 1865.

• The 14th Amendment includes a number of provisions often thought to be part of the Bill of Rights, such as the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause, which are, in fact, later innovations. Birthright citizenship’s advocates claim that the Constitutional justification can be found in this sprawling Amendment, which also includes Amendments barring former Confederate officials from office and addresses Confederate war debts. This Amendment became law in July 1868.

• The 15th Amendment prevents discrimination against voters on the basis of race or skin color. This law was quickly circumvented by a number of laws discriminating against all voters on the basis of income (poll tax) or education (literacy tests). The Southern states eventually figured out how to prevent black citizens from voting while allowing white ones through grandfather clauses.

The Reconstruction Amendments were the first amendments to the Constitution passed in almost 60 years, and represented a significant expansion of federal power.

Perhaps the most important thing to know about the Reconstruction Amendments is that they were largely ineffective. Ranking public officials of the Confederacy were elected to federal government, blacks were disenfranchised as quickly as they were elected to the Senate, and Jim Crow, an entire system of legal discrimination, was erected to return black Americans to their subservient status. With the exception of citizenship for blacks and an end to involuntary servitude, the substance of the rest of the Amendments were largely discarded.

**Black Disenfranchisement as a Prologue to Jim Crow**

The process of black disenfranchisement at the end of the war is important historical context for understanding the rise of Jim Crow. It’s impossible to discuss this period without discussing the role of the Ku Klux Klan and other Democratic Party-allied white supremacist terrorist organizations. You can read more about this in our lengthy and exhaustive history of American militias and paramilitary organizations.

The first attempt to roll back the gains made by black Americans, thanks to the Reconstruction Amendments, was a poll tax introduced by Georgia in 1877. However, the legal rollback of voting rights in particular did not really ramp up until the turn of the century, when Republicans ran on joint tickets with the insurgent People’s Party, also known as the Populist Party. This threat to entrenched Democratic Party political power (and all of the patronage that came with it), while certainly related to the racial question, was arguably a bigger motivator than race. In many cases, such as with poll taxes, there were explicit attempts to exclude white voters sympathetic to the Republican cause alongside black voters. The specter of unity between poor blacks and poor whites loomed large.

Mississippi drafted a new constitution in 1890, which required payment of a poll tax as well as the passing of a literacy test as qualifications to vote. This passed Constitutional muster in 1898, with Williams vs. Mississippi. Other Southern states quickly drafted new constitutions modelled on that of Mississippi. This was known as “the Mississippi Plan.” By 1908, every Southern state had either drafted a new constitution or passed a suffrage amendment to better craft the state electorate to their liking. In 1903, Giles vs. Harris strengthened federal court support of such laws.

Another method of maintaining control was the white primary. In 1923, Texas became the first state to establish primary voting for whites only. This was quickly deemed unconstitutional, so the state simply drafted a new law saying that the Democratic Party could determine its own voters for the primary. The state party quickly moved to exclude all non-white voters, which was entirely legal and Constitutional, because the Democratic Party was a private organization.

This caught the eye of some Congressmen. By 1900, there was discussion of stripping Southern states of some of their Congressional representation in accordance with provisions contained within the Reconstruction Amendments. Not only was the “Solid South” a large voting bloc, due to the one-party nature of many Southern elections, but they were also in charge of a goodly number of committee chairs, meaning that any attempt to strip Southern states of seats was probably going to go precisely nowhere.

Reliable statistics from the era are few and far between, but historians believe that somewhere between one and five percent of eligible black voters were registered by the late 1930s. Very few of these actually voted in general elections, which were a foregone conclusion. In many states, prior to the first and second Great Migrations, the black population ranged upwards of close to 50 percent.

Five border states (Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland) all attempted to pass similar legislation to “the Mississippi Plan,” but failed to do so.

**Redeemer Governments and the Election of 1876**

The disenfranchisement of black Americans in the South was the political precursor for Jim Crow. In addition to legal disenfranchisement, there were also paramilitary actions against both black Americans and Republican voters and candidates. It was not uncommon for Democratic Party-allied paramilitary groups to simply force the Republican candidate or even office holder out of town. Voter fraud was also a tool. As elections became closer, violence against blacks and Republicans increased to keep them away from the polls.

These Southern governments are known collectively as the Redeemer governments. They ruled over most of the South from 1870 until 1910. As we discuss in our history of militias in the United States, the white, pro-Democratic Party militias of the South were largely obsolete by the end of the 19th Century – Democratic Party state governments were doing their jobs for them.

All of this was facilitated by the Compromise of 1877 or the Corrupt Bargain of 1877, depending on one’s point of view. In exchange for certifying Southern votes for Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes, Hayes agreed to:

• Remove federal troops from Florida, South Carolina and Louisiana, the final states where they remained. Hayes campaigned on doing this prior to the bargain.

• The appointment of one or more Southerners to the Hayes Cabinet. This was fulfilled by appointing David M. Key from Tennessee as the Postmaster General.

• A transcontinental railroad passing through the South, using the Texas and Pacific line.

• Legislation to industrialize the Southern economy.

• Northern hands off the South when it came to racial questions.

The first two are often emphasized, however, they are probably the least important parts of the compromise. As stated above, Hayes had already planned to withdraw the remaining troops from the South. The cabinet appointment of Postmaster General was certainly a bigger deal than it would be today, when far fewer people rely upon the mail. The post has not even been a cabinet-level position since the 1970s. The next two are arguably beneficial to everyone in the South, black or white, and in any event, were never enacted.

It’s also worth noting that the Compromise was seen as a way to avoid a potential new wave of bloodshed. At the time, it was widely feared that American politics were going to go the way of Mexico – meaning military strongmen and state violence would resolve closely contested elections. In this context, the Compromise is rather shrewd as Hayes gave up very little with regard to the first two provisions and never enacted points three and four.

The final provision, however, is the one that makes Jim Crow possible. This makes it, historically speaking, perhaps the most significant of the Compromise provisions.

Yard Signs,"
Shortly after Trump was elected president, “HATE HAS NO HOME HERE” (HHNHH) yard signs began adorning the minority-manicured lawns of white-collar, white-skinned liberals.  You’ve seen the sign.  Its message is translated into multiple languages, which is meant to broadcast a globalist diversity of sorts by those who speak not only just English, but that sniffy dialect molded within the narrow confines of a university pedigree loftier than junior college but conspicuously short of Ivy League.  You can all but hear them finish their Starbucks order with that irritating raised inflection on the last syllable. 

The underlying message of the HHNHH yard sign is two-fold.  First, it’s virtue signaling in its most tawdry form.  Yard signs announcing “POVERTY IS BAD” and “I SUPPORT CURING CANCER” would ring just as hollow.  Sorry, but you don’t get a cookie for broadcasting to the world that you oppose hate.  Most people do, and their daily actions are sufficient proof thereof.  A lion doesn’t need to convince people it’s a lion.

Second, the HHNHH yard sign alludes that a home which opposes President Trump is axiomatically hate-free, and, by deductive logic, a home which supports President Trump categorically welcomes hate with open arms.  The sign smugly implies, “I'm a good person, and it's a shame that you're not.”  This insinuation might not rise to the level of hate, but it certainly sinks to the level of arrogance, condescension, and sweeping judgment.  

But over time the HHNHH yard signs faded along with the “I’m With Her” bumper stickers.  The yard sign prophets needed something new, something snarkier, with which to impress their woke comrades and irritate the handyman who lives on the street’s only single story home.  So a new yard sign was handed out that reads like a manifesto.  The sign blares loudly “WE BELIEVE:”, which is followed by (in differing order, and with slightly altered wording, depending on the sign) BLACK LIVES MATTER; NO HUMAN IS ILLEGAL; WOMEN’S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS; LOVE IS LOVE; SCIENCE IS REAL; and KINDNESS IS EVERYTHING. 



They really upped the ante, didn’t they?

The first thought conservatives have looking at this sign is that they agree with every statement on it.  But the purpose of the sign is not to find common ground across the political spectrum, but to further drive a wedge.  The purpose of the sign is to insist that these statements are true only within the narrow ideological limits of the sign owner’s worldview.  If you disagree with the yard sign prophets on any policy point, then, in their minds, you disagree with the statements themselves.  

Let’s break it down by statement:

BLACK LIVES MATTER

Aside from progressive mayors, BLM rioters, and Dylan Roof, one is hard-pressed to find Americans of any political persuasion who behave like black lives don’t matter.  In fact, conservatives take this statement to the next logical steps.  Black lives, White lives and Hispanic lives matter.  Unborn lives matter and police lives matter. 

But by declaring BLACK LIVES MATTER, they are concerned only with black people who have been shot by police.  The justification for the shooting, or the lack thereof, or any other pertinent fact of a specific case, does not factor into their reasoning.  The black victim is merely a prop, brutishly exploited to peddle an anti-police narrative.

But don’t posit to a yard sign prophet any of these seemingly a priori statements without first donning a face shield, because spittle will most definitely fly.  By insisting that all lives matter rather than just those of a single race, you are somehow the racist.  Now that’s a trick that would leave even Houdini scratching his head. 

NO HUMAN IS ILLEGAL

Who is saying that humans are illegal?  It's a conservative idea that human beings not only have a legal right to peacefully exist to pursue their happiness, but should be legally protected at all stages of life, at all income levels, and in every neighborhood.  What this statement is attacking is the concept of illegal immigration.  But a person's immigration status is very different from their right to exist, as the yard sign prophets surely know.  That is why they obfuscate the argument with underhanded statements like this.  Those who scream NO HUMAN IS ILLEGAL do so from the safety of their alarmed homes and gated communities, which serve essentially the same purpose as does a border wall. 

WOMEN’S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS

Who is saying they aren’t?  Certainly not conservatives, for whom human rights (be they for women, gays, ethnic or religious minorities) aren’t conveniently ignored when the offending societies are non-Western.  There are plenty who do treat women like animals and slaves, and who use their culture and religion as an excuse to do so.  And which political party courts these misogynists and defends them against ""phobic"" criticisms?

The purpose of this statement isn’t to promote actual equality into cultures for whom the concept of women’s rights is tantamount to heresy.  The statement is abortion advocacy, pure and simple, and it reflects the most threadbare ad hominem attack in American politics, i.e. if you oppose abortion, you oppose women.  This would be news to Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Jane Addams, and other historical dreadnoughts opposed to abortion, in whose mighty wakes meander the empty vessels of contemporary “feminism.”  

LOVE IS LOVE

Sure.  And broccoli is broccoli.  The point of this hackneyed statement is not a defense of “love,” in the sense of a deep and selfless affection from one person to another.  The purpose is to transpose the definition of marriage with that of love, i.e. if you don’t agree with the definition of marriage as progressives do, then you are opposed to “love.”  If you disagree with the institution of gay marriage yet harbor no animosity whatsoever towards the gay community, it matters not.  You are a hateful bigot whose business must be shut down and whose social life must be cancelled. 

This hijacking of “love” as understood by the advocacy of non-traditional marriage in the Western sense is, like the advocacy of “women’s rights,” oddly ambiguous when the boundaries of acceptable marriage expand in directions seemingly at odds with progressivism.  The LOVE IS LOVE windbags are uncharacteristically quiet about the legal codes in certain non-Western cultures which allow one man to have (own) multiple wives.  Likewise, they are quiet about speaking out against (or for) definitions of “love” and marriage as insisted upon by the likes of NAMBLA.  Whatever doesn’t fit the narrative is ignored.

SCIENCE IS REAL

Science is a process, a methodology employed to determine empirical facts and laws by which we can better understand the world around us.  What science is never is a set of permanently settled, rigid theories that remain immovable despite the ebb and flow of conflicting evidence.  SCIENCE IS REAL was just as true when we “knew” the Earth was flat as when we discovered it was round.  What changed was not the science, but the evidence. 

The SCIENCE IS REAL statement is a transparent reference to global warming, and global warming only.  The statement is meant to ridicule “climate deniers”, i.e. those who “deny” the “settled science” that not only is the Earth warming at logarithmically catastrophic rates, but that mankind (particular Western man) is solely responsible.  These armchair Einsteins have little time for the sciences of biology, genetics, and economics because they don’t conform to the narrative.

One problem with the global warming debate is that it, in its current metamorphosis, is far too politicized from which to derive much objective substance.  The vast majority of partisans on both sides understand very little of the actual science, and instead rely on either conspiracy theories or internet searches for whichever article or chart is tailored to fit their particular bias. 

Since I fall into this category of blissful ignorance, I’m in no position to comment on the science one way or another, though I will say this.  Reasonable skepticism is not anti-scientific, especially when the apocalypse peddlers are batting 0.000 with regards to their predictions ever actually occurring.  I’ll also say that any proposal that punishes Western democracies (who do the most to lower emissions) while subsidizing brutal dictatorships (who do the least) is not a serious solution, but rather a massive transfer of wealth and power unconvincingly cloaked as environmentalism.  Pollution from Chinese smokestacks destroys the planet just as much as pollution from American smokestacks.  This isn’t racism, this is the science you allegedly support.

KINDNESS IS EVERYTHING

This statement can be found in all shapes and sizes in the millennial-old texts of most world religions, but one would struggle to find anything remotely close in the atheistic fanaticism of Karl Marx, Che Guevarra, or Richard Dawkins.   For cultural icons like Bill Maher, Chelsea Handler, and Michael Moore, kindness is more an impediment than a virtue, as are the empathy and tolerance that accompany it.  Our city streets are overflowing with black-masked kindness, and it’ll bash you across the head with a brick if your own kindness is found wanting.

Like its HHNHH predecessor, the WE BELIEVE yard sign isn’t an argument, an ideology, or a philosophy.  It isn’t a set of principles or tenets of a faith.  It has no depth, no complexity, and no animation.  It’s a regurgitation of drive-by gotcha-isms, dutifully parroted with overconfident arrogance and unearned righteousness by those who haven’t thought to the next sentence.

"Why I, a black teenager, don't agree with black lives matter","Before people spam ""whitewashed"", I wanna make it clear that this isn't just gonna be some trash racist post

I feel like the message created by black lives matter is very different to that of the civil rights movement 56 years ago. That movement was one that strived to end both racial division and racial inequality. I can certainly see the stance against racial inequality in BLM, but not racial division.

MLK preached to Americans about black and white Americans being in unison. He promoted the meaning of America's creed, and promoted that black and white destiny are part of one another. He had a dream where the black and white people identified as Americans before they identified by their colour. Unfortunately, this is not the message BLM creates.

BLM has managed to make white people who have felt prejudice towards black people feel even stronger about this by creating demands like defunding police departments (And there is no denying,  police do far more good than harm in society, so defunding them will reduce a lot of the good they do) and by tearing down and destroying the history of countries (such as statues in America and Britain). These attacks on history are like an attack on the pride of people who feel strongly about the importance of their country's history. It has also managed to make black people who strongly hate racism hate it to the point where they want to fight it through violence, and has convinced them that racism is the blame for all problems in their lives.

As you can see above, the message created by BLM is very different to that of the civil rights movement, and I think it's almost like an insult to the legacy of MLK that this is where the struggle against racism has come to.

Another problem with BLM is the fight against systematic racism they preach about, because the truth is, systematic simply isn't real. Every citizen in countries like America has complete equality of opportunity. Everyone is given an equal opportunity to rise to the top. However, not everyone has the same starting point. And the truth is, a higher proportion of the black population in America and these countries begins at a low starting point than the proportion of white people who do. But this isn't because of systematic racism. The system isn't causing this. This is because of historical racism. For the majority of it's history, America has been a racist country, where people of certain skin colours do not have equal opportunities. There has been equality for only 56 years, compared to the roughly 200 years of systematic racisn. This means that, no matter what the system does, there is still going to be inequality between majority black and majority white communities. This is something everyone must accept, and must understand that the solution to this comes in two parts. The government providing funding to black communities to go towards education and quality of life, and black people in these communities understanding that they must take responsibility for their futures and their families' futures (meaning that this mentality of blaming systematic racism must stop).

I feel like the solution to all of this is a movement that wouldn't use methods of violence whatsoever, and instead of protesting against systematic racism which simply isn't real, it should preach to Americans of all races the importance of American values, which seem to have been forgotten over the generations. Through this, I hope, Americans can become united under a single national culture, and would no longer see themselves as divided from each other. It would also convince people in black communities to stop the ideas in black culture that have caused a lack of responsibility, causing things like single motherhood rate since the civil rights movement to go up by 40%.

I doubt that this message will reach many people. Mabye it will be censored. Mabye it will be ignored because of my age. But I really hope to see changes in how the world views race, changes I know we can reach, but not in the way we are currently doing it.

1- Go to BlackLivesMatter.com.
2- Click on the 3 bars on upper right corner and then click the Donate button.
3- Scroll down to Number 2- Read about Actblue Charities (this is where all the donations are going).
4- Go to https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2020&cmte=C00401224
*⬆️ This page will show you where the money has gone that has been donated to Actblue Charities.
5- Click “Expenditures”.
6- Scroll down until you see “Top Vendors/Recipients”.

So if for some reason you don’t understand what you’re seeing what this page is telling you is that hundreds of millions of dollars that have been donated to the black lives matter movement are instead donated directly to Democratic politicians.

Hundreds of millions of dollars donated are not even going to black communities to help in any way, shape, or form! Over 300 MILLION DOLLARS alone went towards “Bernie for President” and Biden’s campaign...none of that went to help black communities AT ALL!

Feel free to correct me if I missed something...

Thank god I found you.,"Hey guys. I am Black, a teacher, a gun owner and a Christian . I got into reddit for the memes and I quickly realized that reddit is a crazy leftwing echo chamber. People post crazy leftist (wrong) information and will downvote or ban anyone who happens to have a different opinion. I have no karma because I refuse to buy into the crazy. I just wanted to post here in hopes I can get rolling. Epstein didn't kill himself, corona came from china and is not as bad as the msm wants us to think, an unborn baby is a life on its own, if you want health insurance work for it. No one owes you anything, no matter how many likes you get.


Edit: Hello my leftist friends. I am a nerd and love Star Trek. Anyone who does not think socialism is a wonderful idea is selfish or just an ass hole. But people are shitty. Not all of them , but most of them. So it will not work because of that. I get it. I left college super brain washed and worked construction for a long time. The whole time I felt cheated because I was doing all the work and the company owner was making the money. ""Nobody cares. Work harder"". What I didn't understand is that the owner also works hard, and was there first. I started working harder and now am in a good place in life. So please before you try to sell me some "" My sales tax on gum is the reason you can have anything"" please understand I have been there. Again ""Nobody Cares. Work Harder""",0,"thank god found you.hey guys . black , teacher , gun owner christian . got reddit memes quickly realized reddit crazy leftwing echo chamber . people post crazy leftist ( wrong ) information downvote ban anyone happens different opinion . karma refuse buy crazy . wanted post hopes get rolling . epstein n't kill , corona came china bad msm wants us think , unborn baby life , want health insurance work . one owes anything , matter many likes get . edit : hello leftist friends . nerd love star trek . anyone think socialism wonderful idea selfish ass hole . people shitty . , . work . get . left college super brain washed worked construction long time . whole time felt cheated work company owner making money . `` nobody cares . work harder '' . n't understand owner also works hard , first . started working harder good place life . please try sell `` sales tax gum reason anything '' please understand . `` nobody cares . work harder ''"

Reddit needs some serious changes to ensure what happened to the Covington boys and Kyle Rittenhouse can't happen again.,"Right now everybody knows that the Covington boys were entirely in the right and were actually the victims of harassment, but at the time Reddit was going absolutely mental about them. The main kid(age 15) was posted to top of all time on r/punchablefaces. Every major thread was slandering him, every major subreddit was abusing him, calling him a ""white supremacist"" and contacting his school and family.

But he was entirely and unequivocally in the right, he was approached by a racist native American man who started smashing a drum in his face while staring him down, completely unprompted. And the thing is everybody knew that at the time, the video was fully available at the time, but every single post made revealing that truth was deleted. Any post that was slightly leaning towards the truth was removed for random reasons that made no sense and the mods had absolutely zero accountability in how they handled what is arguably the most notorious piece of fake news of this century. The controversy revealed some of the most disgusting aspects of humanity, a witch-hunt against literal innocent children. Luckily the main kid sued and won against CNN for estimated low 9 figures and he's moving on to other networks who misrepresented this.

But for all the shit people give Facebook about not deleting fake news Reddit was so much worse in this instance, not only did they not remove the fake stories, all major subs removed only the truth. Videos abusing the kids were let up on r/videos no problem, but videos that actually explained the truth were removed for ""politics"", same thing on all major subs really, if you knew the truth you weren't able to share it with people and try get them to leave the kids alone. All these people abusing children for something that just didn't happen when the full video is out there is so disgusting to me.

The same thing's happening with Kyle Rittenhouse right now, in fact he's already working with the same lawyers that represented the Covington boys against CNN(media's been a bit more careful in blatantly lying about him since that happened, as they should be). You just can't call him a white supremacist who just started firing against innocent black people as is the mainstream prerogative on Reddit right now. First off because it was the most blatant case of self defense known to man when you watch the video, like there's just absolutely no question whatsoever, and second off because the people he ended up killing in self defense were white. He's clearly recorded wiping up graffiti in the city earlier that day and helping store owners with some of the damage caused by riots. The attackers were shouting ""get his ass"" and one of them actually pulled a handgun on him as well. Kyle showed amazing restraint, only making the decision to defend his life after he was already beaten to the ground after attempting to disengage and flee by sprinting away, but his attackers forced him to the ground and one of them raised their handgun to him.

This truth isn't out there on Reddit though, and it's not like you interpret the events in the video in your own way as well, that's objectively what happened. And lawyers are already unanimous on the fact that the worst thing Kyle can be charged for is underage possession of a firearm. Reddit needs serious oversight on things like this. Its impact is just as significant as Facebook's if not more because people take stories on here more seriously. It can't have default subreddits moderate the site in this clearly biased way leading to blatant lies being spread on issues such as this.",0,"reddit needs serious changes ensure happened covington boys kyle rittenhouse ca n't happen again.right everybody knows covington boys entirely right actually victims harassment , time reddit going absolutely mental . main kid ( age 15 ) posted top time r/punchablefaces . every major thread slandering , every major subreddit abusing , calling `` white supremacist '' contacting school family . entirely unequivocally right , approached racist native american man started smashing drum face staring , completely unprompted . thing everybody knew time , video fully available time , every single post made revealing truth deleted . post slightly leaning towards truth removed random reasons made sense mods absolutely zero accountability handled arguably notorious piece fake news century . controversy revealed disgusting aspects humanity , witch-hunt literal innocent children . luckily main kid sued cnn estimated low 9 figures 's moving networks misrepresented . shit people give facebook deleting fake news reddit much worse instance , remove fake stories , major subs removed truth . videos abusing kids let r/videos problem , videos actually explained truth removed `` politics '' , thing major subs really , knew truth n't able share people try get leave kids alone . people abusing children something n't happen full video disgusting . thing 's happening kyle rittenhouse right , fact 's already working lawyers represented covington boys cnn ( media 's bit careful blatantly lying since happened , ) . ca n't call white supremacist started firing innocent black people mainstream prerogative reddit right . first blatant case self defense known man watch video , like 's absolutely question whatsoever , second people ended killing self defense white .

I have become a Republican,"I used to view myself as an independent, and not entirely agreeing with one side. But ever since this chaos in our country, I lean to the right now. The things that liberals are suggesting and saying is absolutely ridiculous, things such as “defund the police”, and “America is inherently racist”.

Regression,"Hi All,

This is my first post on here, but need to clear my mind. I'm an Asian American who immigrated to this wonderful country about 12 years ago. This country has given me the opportunity to become someone and to pursuit the American dream. Seeing the way this country is going truly hurts my heart and my patriotic self, from statues being brought down to this movement that no longer have a meaning. At the start of the movement I was all for it, but now, it really has shifted from a completely unrelated issues. I just don't understand how someone can agree with the logic of the left. Nothing they say or do makes any sense. We are going down a path where erasing history is a must.

Sorry, I just had to get this off of my chest because I love this country so much and to see it go this route really hurts. I really hope we win this election for the sake of preserving this wonderful country which it was based upon freedom, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

EDIT: Some people are asking if this is an alt-account and it is. I did this to protect myself from my main account which I have co-worker/friends who support the left.

/r/Republican Has Been Hijacked By Liberals,"Why is it that the liberals won't even allow us (republicans, conservatives) to have a voice on reddit. Every single thing that gets posted gets downvoted severely by liberals, including the comments within. This is the REPUBLICAN subreddit. If you are a liberal and you are in here - you are going to agree with NOTHING.

I have NEVER been to the /r/liberal subreddit - because I know there is very little that I will agree with there, and I have enough respect for differing opinions to leave them alone on their own subreddit.

The ENTIRE /r/Politics subreddit is completely overrun by liberal Bias. Maybe if /r/politics wasn't a liberal circle-jerk, liberals could argue in the general politics section and would not have to come to /r/republican to find things to disagree with.

I would imagine that the number of republicans on Reddit is dropping by the day as a result of every subreddit being overrun with liberal downvotes. It's a sad day when they hive mind of Reddit drives away all voices of opposition.

Liberals - is this what you want? You want all of reddit to be /r/circlejerk for your political views?

Republicans - share with us some sites where you go to have intelligent political conversation that is not overrun by sneering, runny nose liberals that only want to squelch opposition through power in numbers and not through actual debate.

If you are a republican reading the comments, you'll probably have to click the plus signs next to them, as the liberals in here are downvoting our republican ideas and opinions below the comment threshold in every thread.

:::: Edit to point out that I've received so many liberal downvotes while only posting in /r/republican that I have restrictions on my commenting now. It makes me wait 10+ minutes to make a COMMENT now :::::

Evidence Shows Kamala Harris Covered Up Illegal Wiretaps,"Kamala Harris served as California attorney general from 2011 to 2017, when she took her Senate seat.

Riverside County Superior Court judge Helios Hernandez, appointed by Democrat governor Gray Davis, ordered [624](http://theievoice.com/there-was-so-much-wiretapping-in-riverside-county-even-the-bugs-had-bugs/) wiretaps in 2014, [almost](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/11/dea-wiretap-operation-riverside-california/75484076/) five times more than any other American judge, and 44,000 people and over 2 million conversations were tapped. Hernandez even [got 17 wiretap applications](http://www.prosecutorialaccountability.com/2016/03/03/ca-riverside-countys-massive-wiretapping-binge-faces-its-first-court-challenge/) in one day. Some of Hernandez’s wiretaps [have been found to be illegal by prosecutors](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151214/08492533071/dea-loses-big-drug-case-thanks-to-illegal-wiretap-warrants-prosecutor-calls-procedural-errors.shtml), leading to the dropping of some cases and the surrender of assets seized by the feds. A [federal judge said](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/crime_courts/2016/07/06/riverside-county-wiretaps-judge/86779116/) legal standards “could not have been met” with regard to the Riverside County wiretaps. [Approximately 18 percent](https://www.pe.com/2017/07/02/wiretaps-drop-from-outsized-high-in-inland-empire/) of the more than 4 million conversations wiretapped in the state of California in 2016 were incriminating.

The wiretapping scheme coincided with a period of massive revenue gains for the state of California from civil asset forfeitures overseen by Kamala Harris’ office. In 2014, Riverside County [collected more than $3 million](https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/publications/asset_forf/2014_af/counties-2014.pdf) in civil asset forfeitures.",0,"evidence shows kamala harris covered illegal wiretapskamala harris served california attorney general 2011 2017 , took senate seat . riverside county superior court judge helios hernandez , appointed democrat governor gray davis , ordered [ 624 ] ( http : //theievoice.com/there-was-so-much-wiretapping-in-riverside-county-even-the-bugs-had-bugs/ ) wiretaps 2014 , [ almost ] ( https : //www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/11/dea-wiretap-operation-riverside-california/75484076/ ) five times american judge , 44,000 people 2 million conversations tapped . hernandez even [ got 17 wiretap applications ] ( http : //www.prosecutorialaccountability.com/2016/03/03/ca-riverside-countys-massive-wiretapping-binge-faces-its-first-court-challenge/ ) one day . hernandez ’ wiretaps [ found illegal prosecutors ] ( https : //www.techdirt.com/articles/20151214/08492533071/dea-loses-big-drug-case-thanks-to-illegal-wiretap-warrants-prosecutor-calls-procedural-errors.shtml ) , leading dropping cases surrender assets seized feds .

Trump is handling COVID-19 very well,"


I don’t think that most people realize that ~1/2 of all the cases in the country are coming out of New York City and its surroundings. Besides a few other urban centers, COVID-19 is not spreading uncontrollably fast here. Trump has also freed up billions of dollars towards the recovery effort both medically and economically through the recently passed stimulus package, and the declaration of a national emergency *two weeks ago*. Navy hospital ships have also been docked at various ports across the country. Diagnostic tests are also becoming readily available (there’s a drive-thru to get tested near my house) The ratio of sick to healthy in the USA is a lot better than most European nations. Per 1,000,000 people in America, 250 are ill. Compare that with Italy (1M:1,400) Spain (1M:1,350) Switzerland (1M:1,500) and Germany (1M:600) and many others. A week and a half ago the media was bashing Trump for fear mongering and being to harsh, but now they’re saying he’s not doing shit. Many companies based here have also taken tremendous precautions to keep people and their employees distanced and healthy. Contrary to what some may think, an entire nation with 325 million people can’t just take a 3 month holiday and expect everything to be normal once it ends. Though the CDC and the president have made a few bad decisions, they are still doing their job to the best of their ability, and Trump’s latest approval rating shows that (highest point in his presidency thus far)",0,"trump handling covid-19 well ’ think people realize ~1/2 cases country coming new york city surroundings . besides urban centers , covid-19 spreading uncontrollably fast . trump also freed billions dollars towards recovery effort medically economically recently passed stimulus package , declaration national emergency *two weeks ago* . navy hospital ships also docked various ports across country . diagnostic tests also becoming readily available ( ’ drive-thru get tested near house ) ratio sick healthy usa lot better european nations . per 1,000,000 people america , 250 ill. compare italy ( 1m:1,400 ) spain ( 1m:1,350 ) switzerland ( 1m:1,500 ) germany ( 1m:600 ) many others . week half ago media bashing trump fear mongering harsh , ’ saying ’ shit . many companies based also taken tremendous precautions keep people employees distanced healthy . contrary may think , entire nation 325 million people ’ take 3 month holiday expect everything normal ends . though cdc president made bad decisions , still job best ability , trump ’ latest approval rating shows ( highest point presidency thus far )"

Help an Aussie to Understand,"Hey all, Aussie with a thought/questions and looking for some feedback. I have also post this over at r/democrats where it has been approved, hoping both sides are open for the introspection!

So, whenever one of your political leaders is shown to have done something even their peers find reprehensible (Trump's Ukraine call, Hillary's private email server), the immediate reaction is a whataboutism attacking either the other leader or even just a dubious individual or group from across the aisle. This essentially confirms the disapproval of the favoured leader's actions, otherwise the actions would be plainly defensible outright, no?

This just seems so dopey yet 9/10 its the go-to response, and I know there are smart cookies on both sides. We don't do this to the same degree over here and if anything the party leader is crowned king dipstick and most open to criticism. Your candidates just seem to have ethical rap sheets that could circumnavigate the globe, with any item seeming ripe for disqualification. Both parties have had respectable leaders in the past and most people know somebody in their personal lives they respect - so this is possible. My thinking is that if dems/republicans were more critical of their leaders they might actually build an environment for worthwhile candidates to rise, which might then lead to candidates more palatable to voters across the political spectrum? If ever I had the chance to vote for a respectable candidate of any political leaning that wasn't dripping slime I'd jump at it. Seems like a cut the nose off to spite the face approach to me, or at least spite the other team.

So truly, what's going on here? At first I'd guess it's a compassionate understanding that we all make mistakes, but when it only really applies to one's team captain I'm left stumped.

*Disclaimer: Because it is sure to matter, most of our Aussie politicians from the major parties are spineless centrists so I am not heavily invested in either team. Regardless of the current candidates I don't believe my aligned values of integrity, fortitude and equality are the exclusive property of either US party.*",0,"help aussie understandhey , aussie thought/questions looking feedback . also post r/democrats approved , hoping sides open introspection ! , whenever one political leaders shown done something even peers find reprehensible ( trump 's ukraine call , hillary 's private email server ) , immediate reaction whataboutism attacking either leader even dubious individual group across aisle . essentially confirms disapproval favoured leader 's actions , otherwise actions would plainly defensible outright , ? seems dopey yet 9/10 go-to response , know smart cookies sides . n't degree anything party leader crowned king dipstick open criticism . candidates seem ethical rap sheets could circumnavigate globe , item seeming ripe disqualification . parties respectable leaders past people know somebody personal lives respect - possible . thinking dems/republicans critical leaders might actually build environment worthwhile candidates rise , might lead candidates palatable voters across political spectrum ? ever chance vote respectable candidate political leaning n't dripping slime 'd jump . seems like cut nose spite face approach , least spite team . truly , 's going ? first 'd guess 's compassionate understanding make mistakes , really applies one 's team captain 'm left stumped . *disclaimer : sure matter , aussie politicians major parties spineless centrists heavily invested either team . regardless current candidates n't believe aligned values integrity , fortitude equality exclusive property either us party . *"

The New York Times got it right! You can believe them!,"[In 2012 the New York Times did a story on the front page that  “cast grave doubt on the reliability of widespread mail-in voting” and indicated it was “more vulnerable to fraud than conventional voting.”  But now the New York Times says, pshaw, mail in voting is wonderful!  You can believe them now.](https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-york-times-warned-readers-about-vote-by-mail-concerns-in-2012-now-claims-thats-a-false-narrative)

[The 1619 Project by the New York Times claimed that 1619 was the ""true founding"" of the USA and said that the American revolution was a war by white people trying to stop the British from abolishing slavery.  There is ZERO historical evidence to support this claim.  By the way, this links to the World Socialist Website...when you are so full of shit that even the socialists are saying that they hate the smell, you are REALLY full of shit. ](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/09/22/1619-s22.html)

[The New York Times got multiple Pulitzers for claiming that the Trump campaign had ""repeated"" contact with Russian intelligence officials and colluded with them...a claim which now has been utterly debunked by Peter Strzok's notes and James Comey's own testimony, but the Times never corrected or retracted it.](https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/23/new-fbi-notes-re-debunk-major-nyt-story-highlight-media-collusion-to-produce-russia-hoax/)

[The Times hired an editor who had repeatedly made comments online that were extremely racist against white people.  When the comments were revealed, they ""stood by her""...](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45052534)

[She DID get ""demoted"" from the editorial board...only after she seemed to encourage people **to drop their subscriptions to the paper that she worked for**....](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/463503-sarah-jeong-out-at-new-york-times-editorial-board)

[You could write a book about how the New York Times smeared the Duke lacrosse team.](https://www.amazon.com/Until-Proven-Innocent-Correctness-Injustices/dp/0312384866)

[Did their embarrassment over getting the lacrosse team story wrong teach them?  Nope.  They went after the Covington Catholic students, too!](https://norfolkdailynews.com/commentary/finally-some-justice-for-maligned-covington-catholic-student/article_fe363742-3963-11ea-97b7-2304f3f087c2.html)

[And they LOVE anonymous sources who tell them things like, ""Trump will never walk away from trying to make a deal with North Korea and he'll get played like a fool""...and then Trump **actually did** walk  away from the negotiations.](https://thefederalist.com/2018/05/28/media-double-down-after-new-york-times-gets-busted-peddling-fake-news/)

I mean, it's a lot, right?  **A lot of just getting shit totally wrong.**

But the NY Times can't help themselves.  They are willing to fabricate things when the story seems really, really juicy and potentially damaging to someone they don't like.  

**And they REALLY do not like Trump.**

[So of course when they got that ""hey Trump knew Russians had put bounties on our troops and totally ignored it"" story, they couldn't help but be the ones to *break* it.  Of course, by now it has been completely **debunked.**](https://fair.org/home/in-russian-bounty-story-evidence-free-claims-from-nameless-spies-became-fact-overnight/)

Still, it's the *New York Times*, right?  LEGACY MEDIA...the Old Grey Lady, full of gravitas and staffed with true responsible intellectuals...

The case for Donald J. Trump: A comprehensive guide to why we should re-elect him and reject the Democratic party.,"So for the first time in my life I voted early. Primarily so I don't need to take time off on election day, but also because this is the most consequential election since 1860.

I know that gets thrown around a lot. But it's seemingly true in every way.

To anyone on the fence about Trump, anyone thinking about sitting this one out, any liberal lurkers here looking for a different point of view. Here's why I voted for Donald J. Trump and you should too.

Washington has failed everyday Americans for decades. The establishment cares only about the interest of lobbyists. Most politicians see a significant increase in net worth after becoming a politician. It's often thrown around that Trump became President to serve his own financial interests. [But Donald Trump has lost over 30% of his net worth since becoming President, more than $1 billion.](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-has-lost-1-billion-personal-wealth-running-president-n916221) Trump is a billionaire, he's an old man, he could have retired in peace and luxury, but he didn't. He took on the most stressful job in the world, and sacrificed immensely to do so. If that doesn't say something about his character, I don't know what does.

They say he's a warmonger, but he is the first President since Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) to not get America involved in a new armed conflict. He has drawn down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has averted conflicts with Venezuela and Iran. He has helped negotiate peace deals between North and South Korea, Serbia and Kosovo, and Israel and several Arab states, earning him three nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. [Due to his domestic policies, the US has now become the largest producer of oil in the world, and thus our dependence on the Middle East is no longer.](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/12/investing/us-oil-production-russia-saudi-arabia/index.html)

He has done this all the while going after America's enemies, killing Baghdadi and Soleimani, two of the most wanted terrorists in the world. He stepped up the bombing campaign against ISIS and attacked Syria for crossing the Red Line In The Sand**™** that his predecessor set (and never enforced). He has brought back the tried and true strategy of deterrence through strength, not appeasement, having done away with the Iran nuclear deal (that unfroze billions of dollars of Iran's assets on the promise not to build nuclear weapons).

[He has also negotiated the release of hostages from North Korea, Iran, and the Taliban.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rnc-2020-trump-appears-hostages-he-helped-bring-home-u-n1237960) [He has stepped up the war on human trafficking](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/politics/donald-trump-combat-human-trafficking/index.html) leading to thousands of children being rescued over the past four years. He implemented the Right to Try, allowing terminal patients to skip the red tape for experimental treatments. [He took on Big Pharma and has worked to reduce prescription drug prices.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2020/08/11/why_big_pharma_is_fighting_trump_over_cheap_drugs_519738.html#!)

They say he's a sellout. But he has implemented policies that directly help the average American. He cut taxes for all tax brackets and all sizes of business, leading to the lowest unemployment rates for women, Hispanics, and blacks in history. [For the first time in decades, the average worker saw an increase in real wage growth.](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/are-wages-rising-or-flat/) His policies led to the greatest bull market the US has ever seen. He passed the USMCA trade agreement, replacing NAFTA, [something that achieved overwhelmingly bipartisan support.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/19/21013178/usmca-trade-deal-passes-house-vote-approve-bipartisan-nafta-trump)

And why do people think he's a bad man? Everything I just mentioned is true and verifiable. They say he's a Russian puppet, but he was not the President that allowed Russia to waltz into Ukraine and Syria and take what they wanted (Thanks Obama). Trump has now been cleared twice of the 'Russian collusion' narrative, once by Robert Mueller, and once by a bipartisan Senate investigation.

Donald Trump became the 3rd President to be impeached, out of 45 Presidents in 230 years. [He was the first to be impeached without actually having a crime cited against him.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/12/paul-gigot/donald-trump-would-be-first-us-president-impeached/) Interesting how the Democrats no longer bring up his impeachment...

Let us not forget the Kavanaugh confirmation, and how the Democrats treated a man who had absolutely zero evidence or reason against him.

People blame him for the coronavirus pandemic, [when a significant amount of deaths come from nursing homes in Democratic states with Democratic governors, that ordered sick nursing home patients to stay in the homes](https://www.newsmax.com/us/house-oversight-elderly-vulnerable/2020/06/15/id/972323/).

[Joe Biden called Trump's travel ban fear mongering and xenophobic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAdzW-mRKTk). [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZBFUA0JjFk)  encouraged Americans to gather in China Town to rebuke Trump's ""xenophobia"" AFTER the travel ban from China. Let us not forget, Trump imposed the travel ban while [the WHO was saying there was no evidence of human to human transmission](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-no-transmission-coronavirus-tweet-was-to-appease-china-guardian-2020-4?op=1) and [Dr. Fauci was saying there was nothing to worry about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqg2kQDlPKw).

And who is the alternative? Joe Biden, a man who has been in DC for 47 years, is responsible for the 1994 crime bill that put a generation of black men behind bars (the opposite of [President Trump's First Step Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act), allowing a pathway for non-violent drug offenders to be released with a fresh start). Joe Biden, a man with [a history of racist comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJpnGCHtnA) and [touching little girls inappropriately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4PLSPvJ9BY). Joe Biden, Vice President to the first black President, who chose to do nothing about systemic racism for 8 years (because it only exists when they're not the ones in power, right?).

The Democrats are a party that want to eliminate the electoral college, pack the Supreme Court, make Puerto Rico and Washington DC a state to pack the House and Senate with more Democrats (in the case of DC, against the founding father's wishes, but I guess dying wishes only matter when coming form Democrats). They want to defund the police, restrict your Second Amendment right, open the borders, and send out hundreds of millions of blank ballots. Do these sound like the policies of people who are looking out for *you*? Or the policies of a party that is looking our for *themselves*?

We live in a world where black is white, up is down, war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Kyle Rittenhouse is apparently a murdering white supremacist, despite no evidence of him being a white supremacist [and just needing to watch the video to see it was clear as day self defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSU9ZvnudFE).

Apparently White Supremacists are the greatest threat to this country. Antifa and BLM? The groups that riot, beat, loot, murder and burn stuff down? Yeah, according to Democrats they're no problem.

Liberals have come to be driven by blind hate. The same way the Bolsheviks were, the same way the Nazis were, the same way the Khmer Rouge were, the same way the Chinese Communist Party were. **No one ended up on the wrong side of history by thinking they were the bad guys.** They all thought they were righteous and justified.

And that is where we are at. The left has been driven up into such a blind rage, [driven by fake news and pure propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ilHJOkY4k), that they are willing to let things escalate.

And that is why we must vote for Donald J. Trump. He is not perfect. He is not a god. But he has consistently done what is best for this country.

And remember, it's okay to be in the ideological minority. You know who was one of the first Presidents to win the electoral college but lose the popular vote? [Our party's first President, Abraham Lincoln.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_presidential_election) If we instead opted for a ranked popular vote, he would have never become President and a Southern Democrat would have won. And I'm sure we're all glad that that man became President.

If this does not convince you, I don't know what will.

God bless.

If you could share this with friends, family, people unsure about Trump, it would be greatly appreciated. I put a lot into this. Not **A LOT** but enough to be sad if no one ever sees it.

**Top-level domain**

**org** top-level domain stands for “organization” and is primarily used for nonprofit websites such as charities, NGOs, open source projects, and educational platforms. This extension was one of the original domains established in 1985, and is therefore perceived as stronger and more credible than newer alternatives.

[https://antiracistaction.org/history/](https://antiracistaction.org/history/)

ORG ? 

They choose ORG in lieu of net, edu, black, biz, etc. while tells me they rather be considered an organization in lieu of a radical

Per the Antifa site “Antifa is not a unified group; it is loose collection of local/regional groups and individuals”

These autonomous bodies are cleverly designed/camouflaged similar to any terrorists organization. Donations are received Worldwide and shared with each autonomous body; its a quasi-independent clandestine cell system. 

**Based on the information above, these cells are well organized and (funded quite well) and cause terrorists activity without a cause to make things better.** 

**18 U.S. Code § 2331:** Terrorism is defined as consisting of activities that ""involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State….intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; influence the policy of a government by intimidation; or…affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.""

I'm a Democrat Who Has Been Lurking Here for the Past Few Days,"So obviously as the title reads, I am a democrat and I've been reading the posts you guys put up here. With the election going on I figured I would try and get a perspective from the other side. I would like to say that the vast majority of you all seem like great people. I know that Reddit leans so far left that it might fall off the edge of the internet eventually, so I understand how being republican/conservative on this app can be frustrating. I actually agree with a lot of the points and arguments you guys make, I do disagree with some, but not nearly as many as I thought I would. I just think that it's the far extremists on both sides that are making everything seem so damn polarized right now. In reality, I bet 95% of us want similar things, but the media makes it seem as though we are polar opposites. I'm not sure about you all but I am tired of all of this. I am tired of the hate from the extremists on both ends, I'm tired of the politics smothering social media platforms, I am tired of this awful tension in the air all the time, and I am tired of being told that other Americans are my ""enemy"". I want to feel united as a country, not divided. After reading a ton of posts here over the past two days it seems like a lot of you all feel the same.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I would like to say that the overwhelmingly large amount of positivity in the comments is great to see. Also, I know it's not a lot of upvotes so far but it's the most I've ever received on Reddit so thank you all so much.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Thank you all for the awards, I feel like I need to prepare a speech or something. But as I mentioned before, all the messages and comments that I have seen so far have been nothing but overwhelmingly positive. It gives me a lot of hope for the future.

The Media Won,"Hey guys,

im sitting over here in Europe (Italy) and I am just amazed how the media changed it's attitude towards the US in a matter of days!

The last 4 years they didnt write anything good about the US, about President Trump or about the Republican Party. And on inauguration day there were like hundrets of articles how good this is for the world, how Biden is the saviour of western civilization and that all Problems will be gone soon.

Where did investigative journalism go? The whole media apparatus is purely political nowdays. They dont care about the Hunter Biden story for example but as soon as Trump misspells a word they go craaazy.

The media is acting like a child who finally got their toy they wanted for so long.

It is disgusting! And the sad thing is we cant do nothing about it.

The media is the real Enemy of the 21st century! Not just in the US, but in the entire world!

"Well, I'm voting straight-ticket Republican, Trump and all","I made this username a couple years ago and that was my sentiment at the time. I was never a 'vote blue no matter who' type because that mentality allows the DNC to do whatever they want, and I frankly won't be told to fall in line. I voted 3rd party in '04, Obama in '08, 3rd party in '12 and '16. State and local politicians I've voted for have mostly been Democrat. My views have never fallen cleanly on one side or the other, but I've mostly leaned liberal.

This brings me to Why I'm Voting Republican:  
1. Woke shit. I've been on the receiving end of woke hatred over men who fancy themselves women for a long time. I'm well acquainted with critical theory and all its crazy spawn. I'm not down for the struggle sessions, the authoritarianism, the illiberal silencing of dissent. Now that we have Evergreen playing out in the streets, schools, and HR departments across the Western world, I have no choice but to vote for the party standing against it. This alone would be enough for me to vote for Trump.  
2. Media is lying to me. I believed those pictures of kids in cages were put there by Trump. I believed the shooting of Breonna Taylor was the result of a no-knock warrant executed on the wrong address. I believed Trump said neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching with tiki torches were ""fine people."" Turns out I was a sucker, and god damn am I *tired* of this ""peaceful protester"" shit the media is on about.  
3. Fuck the DNC. I wanted Bernie in 2016 and we all know how dirty they did him. When Trump won, my immediate thought was 'at least the DNC will learn their fucking lesson.' Well friends, they're much more resistant to learning than I anticipated. This time around there were a few candidates I could have gotten on board with, but of course the DNC won't let anyone remotely subversive get on the ticket. Fuck em.  
4. LAW AND ORDER. I live in Oregon. It's not going well. Fuck antifa. Fuck BLM. Fuck Kate Brown. Fuck Ted Wheeler. Fuck everyone allowing tent cities full of junkies to blight the landscape. Fuck every 'ACAB' sniveling child.  
5. Yay middle east peace deals.  
6. Fuck China.  
7. Biden is frail and will be 78 and Harris is terrifying and I haaaate her.  
8. Working class. I don't know when the Democrats decided they weren't the party of labor, but now they mostly look down their ivory tower noses at anyone with a little mud on their boots.  
9. Democrats talking about court packing. No, no, no, hell no.  
10. Democrats talking about getting rid of the electoral college, thus disenfranchising the interests of rural people. Nope, never gonna happen.  
11. I'm patriotic. I don't like that seeing an American flag on someone's house, vehicle, or clothing is a pretty good indicator of them being a Republican. Regarding the Democrat party and liberals in general, where is their love of country? “National pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a necessary condition for self-improvement.” ― Richard Rorty

As for Trump himself, I think he's a boor. But he's not as big of a bastard as I had believed and I understand him a bit better. He's gonna win for sure, which is not something I thought before the riots started. I'm preemptively pissed about the future of abortion rights, but at least my free speech and gun rights will remain intact. With those two, I have a seat at the table to fight for the rest. 

I'm honestly hoping for a landslide because I think it might be the only thing that can slap liberals hard enough they wake up and get on a better path. The nation works best when there is a healthy push and pull between liberalism and conservatism, and we need to be able to agree on the foundational structures of our country. I see a huge number of left-leaning people refusing to come to the table to talk and wanting to break our system when they don't get their way, and making it clear that won't win them power is the issue of the election.",0,"well , 'm voting straight-ticket republican , trump alli made username couple years ago sentiment time . never 'vote blue matter ' type mentality allows dnc whatever want , frankly wo n't told fall line . voted 3rd party '04 , obama '08 , 3rd party '12 '16 . state local politicians 've voted mostly democrat . views never fallen cleanly one side , 've mostly leaned liberal . brings 'm voting republican : 1. woke shit .

Hi! The sub is public again. We took the sub private due to a massive influx of hostile traffic.,"Don't believe me?

[Well, we get subreddit stats...and here it is in image form.](https://imgur.com/a/GGvvtMi)

While the situation at the Capitol was happening, we were inundated NOT by our USUAL users, but by leftists.

It was ugly.  We decided that:

[We are unpaid mods and do not owe reddit anything.  We were protecting our regular users from abuse and protecting ourselves...the mods... from having to deal with bullshit when frankly, many of us just wanted to be dedicating OUR time to PRAYING for peace in DC.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9AbeALNVkk)

Not a single person has ANYTHING intelligent to say WHILE a situation is happening.

We definitely started to see that as users rushed in to try to call us violent traitors.

So ... we just shut the sub.  

Made it private...and tried to add known users as approved users.

We reserve our right to do this again in future...because we will NOT be abused.  We will shut that right down.

Again...we aren't paid and we're not obliged to stay open.

We tried to add mods.  But conservatives are overwhelmed on reddit by leftists.

There's NO way to have enough mods to prepare for the lefty hordes to rain down on you like that.

IN SHORT.  

WE WENT PRIVATE.  WE HAD GOOD REASON.  IF ABUSED LIKE THAT WE MAY DO IT AGAIN.

Good to see everyone again.

VP Debate: one part that really stuck with me on the difference between Democrats and Republicans,"I was watching a rerun of  the VP debate yesterday (I know I’m late) and one line (I guess one part) that really stuck with me about the difference between Democrats and Republicans. 

I forget what exactly was said but Harris was berating Pence for not social distancing / wearing masks / etc. Pence’s reply really stuck with me because it was along the lines of “You want to tell people what to do, we trust the American people are smart enough to think for themselves”

And that line really really stuck with me. I came here from Russia years ago and while I was born after the iron curtain fell, my parents weren’t so lucky. So many stories about “knowing a guy”, countless instances of “back door favors”

These aren’t evil people, just regular folks trying to get by (grandma was a teacher, gramps was an engineer in a factory). All this shit they had to do, was because the fucking government made regular life impossible.  To me even I hate authority on that level, I just hate people telling me what to do because I feel like “hey man do you think I’m dumb “

Democrats seem to be in this backslide or more and more regulations and I saw it first hand on a recent trip to Cali. While I can’t put my finger on it, the whole place just felt “Over regulated”, which is a real fucking shame because it’s gorgeous there. 

Republicans on the other hand are more keen on stepping back and building a solid foundation for you to go off of. I don’t need the government doing everything for me, just please give me the basics and I got it from here. 

I feel like Pence’s comment is a complete reflection of this difference in ideas. I don’t agree with everything the Republicans do but one thing I am 100% on board with is the notion of “hey we’re just going to leave you the fuck alone”

Edit: Thanks for the pin mods.

Edit 2: Found a good opinion piece from the LA Times that illustrates the “over regulation” in Cali very well, particularly when it comes to housing https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-broughel-hamilton-overregulation-housing-california-20190703-story.html",0,"vp debate : one part really stuck difference democrats republicansi watching rerun vp debate yesterday ( know ’ late ) one line ( guess one part ) really stuck difference democrats republicans . forget exactly said harris berating pence social distancing / wearing masks / etc . pence ’ reply really stuck along lines “ want tell people , trust american people smart enough think ” line really really stuck . came russia years ago born iron curtain fell , parents ’ lucky . many stories “ knowing guy ” , countless instances “ back door favors ” ’ evil people , regular folks trying get ( grandma teacher , gramps engineer factory ) . shit , fucking government made regular life impossible . even hate authority level , hate people telling feel like “ hey man think ’ dumb “ democrats seem backslide regulations saw first hand recent trip cali . ’ put finger , whole place felt “ regulated ” , real fucking shame ’ gorgeous . republicans hand keen stepping back building solid foundation go . ’ need government everything , please give basics got . feel like pence ’ comment complete reflection difference ideas . ’ agree everything republicans one thing 100 % board notion “ hey ’ going leave fuck alone ” edit : thanks pin mods . edit 2 : found good opinion piece la times illustrates “ regulation ” cali well , particularly comes housing https : //www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-broughel-hamilton-overregulation-housing-california-20190703-story.html"

Gina Carano vs Nick Cannon,"Gina Carano just got canned by Lucasfilm for supposedly 'anti-Semitic comments' where she 'compared the Holocaust to being a Republican'. Since Cannon recently got his job back, and Gina Carano has lost potential millions from future inclusions in the new Lucasfilm universe of films and TV shows, not to mention any further damage to her acting career, I thought this would be a good time to compare what they actually said, or even implied.

Gina Carano - 

""Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbours .. even by children. Because history is edited, most people today don't realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbours hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?""

[https://twitter.com/djarinculture/status/1359547709900922884](https://twitter.com/djarinculture/status/1359547709900922884)

Nick Cannon - 

On a June 30th episode of the podcast 'Cannon's Class', Cannon aired an interview with Richard Griffin, better known as Professor Griff, a former member of Public Enemy who was fired from the group after he said Jews responsible for “the majority of wickedness that goes on across the globe” in a 1989 interview with The Washington Times. When Griffin stood by his comments on Cannon’s Class, Cannon replied, “You’re speaking facts. There’s no reason to be scared of anything when you’re speaking the truth.”

According to Cowboy State Daily, Wiggins Construction, based in Powell, Wyoming, has taken trolling to a whole new level — every time a customer orders a new roof, they will receive a new AR-15 free of charge.

  The AR (which means “Armalite,” not “Assault Rifle” as the left so often claims) is a versatile semi-automatic rifle that can be configured to utilize a myriad of ammunition, though.223 rounds are most common, the outlet reported. It’s also the boogeyman for progressives who seek to dismantle the 2nd Amendment.

Matt Thomas, Wiggins Construction’s marketing director, told the Daily that the deal is a way to welcome newcomers to their newfound land of freedom.",0,"blue state liberals go berserk wyoming roofing company offering new ar-15 newcomers & # x200b ; https : //www.westernjournal.com/blue-state-liberals-go-berserk-wyoming-roofing-company-offering-new-ar-15-newcomers/ ? ff\_source=email & ff\_medium=ctbreaking & ff\_campaign=breaking & ff\_content=conservative-tribune blue state liberals go berserk wyoming roofing company offering new ar-15 newcomers lord , mcintyre olgrinmore according cowboy state daily , wiggins construction , based powell , wyoming , taken trolling whole new level — every time customer orders new roof , receive new ar-15 free charge . ar ( means “ armalite , ” “ assault rifle ” left often claims ) versatile semi-automatic rifle configured utilize myriad ammunition , though.223 rounds common , outlet reported . ’ also boogeyman progressives seek dismantle 2nd amendment . matt thomas , wiggins construction ’ marketing director , told daily deal way welcome newcomers newfound land freedom ."

What makes this culture of perpetual victims so appealing to those on the left?,"It's approval seeking. Leftists have created an entire culture that praises victims for their ""bravery"" when they speak about how they were victimized for this or that. The greater the tale of want and woe, the more recognition is heaped upon them. It boils down to a serious lack of self-esteem, due in part to the hollowness of their childhoods. These are mostly young people who grew up in a time when ""Everyone is a winner"" and participation trophies were handed out like candy. Now that they're grown they don't have a solid foundation of self worth to hold them up, so they must look to others for that approval. So they seclude themselves among their own kind in ""safe spaces"" or among others who will tell them what they want to hear in order to use them for political ends.

It is their parents who have failed them. They neglected to raise these children to learn from mistakes and failure. Instead allowing them to believe that somehow, there is equal, if not more, value in failure than in victory.

Let's Not Forget the Other Times Fauci Was Wrong or Lied.,"Perhaps old news here, but how is it that this guy had a job post 1983  after this epic failure? Fauci claimed that children living in close quarters could catch AIDS from family members.  


***""The mysterious and deadly AIDS disease may be transmitted by routine close contact in a family household""***  
[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/05/05/Household-contact-may-transmit-AIDS/7738420955200/](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/05/05/Household-contact-may-transmit-AIDS/7738420955200/)  


&#x200B;

*See, we have seen this pattern before. Fauci speculates wildly on the transmittable and severity of a disease, gets a cult following who looks at him as savior, and when he walks it back and makes it sound less bad... he's a hero.*

*Sound familiar?*

In May 1983, amid the rapidly escalating AIDS crisis, a doctor at the  National Institutes of Health (NIH) promoted a stunning theory about the newly encountered disease in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Noting that the same issue of the journal contained an article documenting one of the first cases of the immunodeficiency disease’s appearance in an infant, the author sounded an alarm about  “the possibility that routine close contact, as within a family  household, can spread the disease.”  


The article took an  increasingly speculative turn in promoting this new theory. “If indeed  the latter is true, then AIDS takes on an entirely new dimension,” it  continued. “If we add to this possibility that nonsexual, non-blood-borne transmission is possible, the scope of the syndrome may be enormous.” Although the article reiterated the need to “be cautious” in accepting these findings as they awaited more evidence, the discovery “should at least alert us to the possibility that we are truly dealing with AIDS in children,” as transmitted through routine interaction.  


The  author of the article has since attained widespread familiarity. It was  Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a rising star within the NIH bureaucracy.  


Press  accounts, noticing Fauci’s article, immediately sounded the alarm.  “Household contacts can transmit AIDS,” read one nationally syndicated  report on the UPI wire dated May 5, 1983. The Associated Press queried  the next day “Does AIDS spread by Routine Contact?” and quoted Fauci as  their lead authority. The New York Times raised the specter of household  transmission between family members, invoking Fauci’s commentary as its  main authority.

*Chicken Little was at it again in 2010, except this time on the other end. No money to be made on Hatians, so let em die...* 

On February 1, 2010, less than a month after the devastating earthquake  that destroyed much of Haiti, Anthony Fauci went on the National  Institute of Health’s radio program to talk about health concerns in  Haiti following the quake.  


The audio of the interview sits unlisted on YouTube with only six views at the time of the writing of  this article. In it, Fauci says “We often hear people say, mistakenly,  but understandably, they’re concerned about an outbreak of cholera.  There is no cholera in Haiti, so it would be extremely unlikely that  there would be an outbreak of cholera in Haiti.”  


RARE AUDIO: Dr.  Fauci WRONGLY predicted ""there is no cholera in Haiti so it would be  extremely unlikely that there would be an outbreak."" Then, as the UN was  beginning to cover up its role as the source, Fauci claimed cholera was  already ""there somewhere""   


[https://realalexrubi.substack.com/p/saint-anthony-fauci-the-hidden-history](https://realalexrubi.substack.com/p/saint-anthony-fauci-the-hidden-history)
