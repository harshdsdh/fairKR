Here's an issue that should unite liberals and the left: Trump's fascistic tactics in Portland. Why aren't we talking about this more?,"Many of you already know about this, but for those who don't. Take a look at this timeline of the protests in Portland: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Portland,_Oregon

**June**

* Mostly peaceful, few stories of mild civil unrest
* No request for federal assistance from Mayor Wheeler or Governor Brown
* No constitutional authority for Trump to intervene

**Late June**

Trump issues an executive order to protect statues. Because of course he fucking did. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_deployment_of_federal_forces_in_the_United_States#Founding_of_PACT

This gives him the constitutional excuse he needs to not only assemble a task force of federal agents, but to enter cities where the precious statues might be endangered.

**July**

After the feds get involved, it's just story after story of riots and violence.

**August**

Feds finally pull out, and it immediately gets more peaceful. Not as peaceful as June, unsurprisingly. 

The fucking priorities of this man. In the middle of a pandemic, he issues an executive order to protect statues in order to give himself an excuse to send the federal government into a city against the wishes of the mayor and state governor. He places them directly in the path of the protests, deliberately encouraging conflicts between protesters and the feds. A few kidnappings into unmarked vans later, Trump decided he's collected enough video clips for FOX News and withdraws. Things immediately settle down.

Trump doesn't give a fuck about those statues, but he knows the mouthbreathing conservative culture warriors do. How fucking blatant is that? Everyone on the left and in the center should be outraged by this. Everyone on the right, fuck you.

**edit:**

I think my original post was maybe too focused on the timeline in Oregon, which is important to the story, but not quite as alarming as the executive order protecting statues which is really what makes this whole thing fascist.

Executive Order 13933, Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence, **has been interpreted as allowing federal officers to be deployed without the permission of individual U.S. states.** It's also been used to authorize domestic surveillance.

I don't know how anybody could read about this and not be alarmed. This is without precedent. Don't take it from me, though. [Take it from FOX News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/judge-napolitano-operation-legend-federal-troops-chicago):

>“If the state officials or local officials consent to the introduction of federal assets on the streets and for law enforcement purposes there is no constitutional impediment,” [Judge Napolitano] explained. “But if they don't consent, then there is a constitutional impediment.”

I know we haven't always gotten along, progressives, leftists, liberals, centrists, libertarians, and so on. But please take a long hard look at the base principles of whichever ideology you favor.

I think the vast majority of people who hold those principles should be able to agree on this one thing. Right wingers, you're going to regret this path. Abandon your shit ideology and join the rest of the free world already.

**edit 2:**

The more I think about this, the worse it gets. What that executive order achieves:

1. There is no federal law prohibiting damage to state monuments and statues. There are state laws, but there's no federal law.

2. So the executive order creates a new type of ""forbidden"" behavior that was not forbidden before. Again, it's not a law or a crime at the federal level.

3. It authorizes the creation of a massive federal paramilitary force in order to enforce this new federal prohibition against the forbidden behavior.

4. The force can be deployed into states and cities even against the consent of the state and city government.

5. Destroying statues on state property is already a crime in every state, does that make this less bad? Yes. In a more charitable view, you could say that this is just the federal government enforcing the law on behalf of the state when the state itself refuses to do. Never mind that many cities were actually okay with the statues being destroyed and in many cases even announced that they would take them down themselves.

This will definitely be challenged in the courts, so it may yet be ruled unconstitutional. By the new 6-3 Supreme Court. If they find it constitutional, here's one potential way to state the precedent: ""An executive order can prohibit a behavior and enforce this under threat of violence, even against the will of state and local governments, so long as the prohibited behavior is already illegal in that state.""

This isn't good. One of tactics that city governments use to deal with protests and riots is to basically stop enforcing some petty crimes. Graffiti and minor vandalism particularly, or allowing statues to be destroyed which in many cities actually did a pretty damn good job of calming everyone down.

Now Trump can legally escalate any protest to violence in any American city. No meaningful protest can avoid producing some amount of graffiti, littering, vandalism, noise level laws. He can use it selectively too: aggressive and heavy handed federal involvement at BLM protests, no federal involvement at Proud Boys protests. ""Everyone has been calling these guys 'fascists' but at least they can protest peacefully, unlike the other side.""

This isn't a good path to be heading down.

Fox News and Trump supporters have already decided the New York Times report on Trump's taxes is fake news. Got me thinking....,"A big problem with a lot of remaining Trump supporters is that they're happy enough with their individual lives that they don't see the need for candidates that promote change.

The things that upset them most in their day to day lives are the ""bad"" things they hear about that other people are doing. So they're going to vote for the person they think will stop the ""bad things"".

They are also heavily group focused and do not want to have an opinion that is different from their people. They trust their people and that someone has done the research even if they ""don't have time for that"".

If you had been a part of thier group and you disagree, it's assumed that you're changing groups and becoming brainwashed so your points will be dismissed.

So how do we actually win them over?

I think we have to make them think we're not too different from them whenever possible. And speak only to the things that affect them directly or morally infuriate them.

If they're a one policy voter with abortion- talk to them about how you used to be ""pro life"" too until you read about it and learned that more people are supported in their and their babies lives through the pro choice movement.

If they are worried about their taxes going up and the government being too big, talk about how Trump has not helped in those departments and how Biden's tax plan is actually more favorable for them.

They don't care about our causes. We have to convince them on grounds that matter to them.

Alternative to Court Packing,"1. Eliminate a set number of Justices.\*
2. Have a president nominate a new justice in the first and third year of their term.
3. Establish implied consent from the Senate after six months.
4. Set a term limit of twenty years from when this law is established.
5. Set some minimum qualification requirements for Judges and Justices; Such as rated qualified by the American Bar Association.

It would eliminate the uncertainty of how many justices get nominated by a single president. It would make the court less 'swingy' and more steady. This is a less partisan method of improving the court in the long term. It does not set a precedent of just increasing the number of justices every presidency and does not further entrench the court as a partisan institution.

So what do you guys think?

The more he realizes this the crazier he will get. He is trying to figure out how to loose and still look like a winner. To us that is crazy. To Trump it is the only way he knows how to loose. Which is to claim it wasn't a fair election. He will go the rest of his life claiming the election was stolen from him.

PA Voter Here - I'm Moving Out of State Next Week (Temp). Already on Vote By Mail. How Can I Vote for Biden in Pennsylvania,"Hi all, thanks in advance if you're able to help or send me to a place I can find it

I'm a Pennsylvania registered voter but moving out of state next week. It's a temporary move so I'm still a PA resident and not the state I'm moving to (NY). I'll be there past the election 

I want to make sure I vote for Biden!

I'm already signed up for VBM from the primary. I will be here when early in person voting starts on 9/29, but leaving next day. So VBM ballots are supposed to start going out on 9/29, I will obviously not be here when it gets delivered

How can I still cast this vote?

I know early in person starts on 9/29. But isn't that for voters who haven't requested VBM only? I thought my mail ballot would have just been mailed out by 9/29, so I can't use in person early. I'm not sure, if anyone knows?

Or can I change the address where my VBM is sent? If they can send to my temporary address in NY that's perfect, but I wasn't sure. Anyone know?

Or perhaps request an excuse absentee? But again but sure if my current VBM ballot being sent prevents that.

Thanks if anyone is able to help",1,"pa voter - 'm moving state next week ( temp ) . already vote mail . vote biden pennsylvaniahi , thanks advance 're able help send place find 'm pennsylvania registered voter moving state next week .

Which close Senate races should we donate to?,"Just thought I'd try to get a better feel from you guys on where my donation(s) might be most effective right now.  I'm going by the rule of thumb that it's more effective to give directly to the candidates themselves than say, the DNC for them to use however. I tried to generically search for advise that might give a little bit more of bird's eye view over all the races, but came up short. So if you had say, $100, (I intend to give more, ) how would you spread it strategically over the tighest or most vital races? Of course every race is important, but maybe you have insights or resources into who actually needs the money more right now?

I've used Actblue for Biden a few times, and given a little to Amy McGrath, but recently heard that she may not be able to overtake McConnell, and the money could be better used elsewhere? I also heard that Harrison running against Lindsey actually has plenty of money, and the polls are still tight AF. So I'm just skeptical.

Setup a stand on campus to get people to register?,"Hi everyone!
So I just had a sudden idea and wanted to see if anyone has any suggestions or experience with something like this.

I’m currently enrolled in a community college in rural Kansas. Campus is pretty dead but ppl still are still on campus for class, so I had this idea of setting up a table and setting up a couple laptops that people can stop by to quickly register to vote (our deadline to register is October 13). Hold up a couple signs to call people over and let them know what we’re there for and yeah. 


The thing is that I’m not very involved with my campus or any organizations. I’m assuming I would have to ask some official from the school to be able to do this. I’m not a very social person, in fact I’m pretty shy but I feel very strongly in sticking it to Trump supporters here in this town and getting people to register. Especially since I know that if a lot of us younger people get together we might bare substantial weight in this election.

Any opinions, suggestions? Is this even reasonable or should i leave it alone and let someone else better versed take care of it? How would my school take it if I asked them? 

I was thinking this doesn’t have to be a big deal, but maybe I’m wrong and there’s a lot more to it? After all, I don’t really see any political groups in my town trying to get people to register or anything so maybe there’s a reason for that.",1,"setup stand campus get people register ? hi everyone ! sudden idea wanted see anyone suggestions experience something like . ’ currently enrolled community college rural kansas . campus pretty dead ppl still still campus class , idea setting table setting couple laptops people stop quickly register vote ( deadline register october 13 ) . hold couple signs call people let know ’ yeah . thing ’ involved campus organizations . ’ assuming would ask official school able . ’ social person , fact ’ pretty shy feel strongly sticking trump supporters town getting people register . especially since know lot us younger people get together might bare substantial weight election . opinions , suggestions ? even reasonable leave alone let someone else better versed take care ? would school take asked ? thinking ’ big deal , maybe ’ wrong ’ lot ? , ’ really see political groups town trying get people register anything maybe ’ reason ."

What are your opinions on Puerto Rico becoming a state?,"Hey all. So I’m a Hispanic-American living in Puerto Rico. As of now I am grimly witnessing what was the slow descent of what was left of American Democracy turn into a full blown high-speed train headed to fascism and I can do absolutely diddly squat about it because I don’t have a say when it comes to the presidential election. I can vote for exactly zero senators, and can only vote for a single-non-voting representative in the House (she can only vote in assigned committees). On the other hand, the outcome of the whole election will directly impact what happens over here, negatively or positively. We are 3.1 million Americans in a state of limbo where we are not our own country and therefore cannot trade with other countries, but we also can’t participate in any meaningful way in the laws that Congress approves over us or over the nation as a whole. 


I wanted to ask y’all directly. What are your thoughts on admitting Puerto Rico as a state? 

Before you answer here are some facts:

1. Puerto Rico is about the size of Iowa. It would have 6 electoral votes. 

2. I can see Puerto Rico as a lean D state, having 1-2 Dem Senators and 2-3 Dem representatives, depending on the election year. 

3. Essentially, we lean Democrat, but we could easily go Republican if it’s a wave year and with the right messaging.

DEEP STATE?,"So, I have a question. If Democrats are all part of a ""deep state"" conspiracy, is it the lamest of all overthrows of any government anywhere? Everything the Democrats have done since trump has been in office has been a colossal failure. How can you take over a government with all the following rules and working within the boundaries of the law. 
I mean if you are going to overthrow a government you would need a charismatic leader that could make people believe whatever he wants, you would want to devide the nation and make your followers feel as if there very life is at stake and the other half of the nation wants to subjugate every aspect of there lives. You want to get leaders of your party to fall lock step in behind you. Skirt the law, convince your followers that you are exactly like they are even though it should be obvious that he is nothing like you. Start saying that everything the other party does is in antithesis of what you belive and you need to defend it to save the world. Start saying that if the other party wins it can only be because they cheated and lied. Then you, yourself lie, lie, lie never admit fault or weakness. If some disagrees with you or your agenda start blowing the dog whistles and destroy them. Push, push,push don't stop never pass up an opportunity to denigrate and sow seeds of doubt and discontent. Change the rules to meet your needs. Make small changes that no one would suspect anything until all the rules have been change to benefit you. And finally get help from an enemy state. 
Democrats haven't done any of these things, so I guess we need to get on the ball before the Republicans do....this.....shit!",1,"deep state ? , question . democrats part `` deep state '' conspiracy , lamest overthrows government anywhere ? everything democrats done since trump office colossal failure . take government following rules working within boundaries law . mean going overthrow government would need charismatic leader could make people believe whatever wants , would want devide nation make followers feel life stake half nation wants subjugate every aspect lives . want get leaders party fall lock step behind . skirt law , convince followers exactly like even though obvious nothing like . start saying everything party antithesis belive need defend save world . start saying party wins cheated lied . , lie , lie , lie never admit fault weakness . disagrees agenda start blowing dog whistles destroy . push , push , push n't stop never pass opportunity denigrate sow seeds doubt discontent . change rules meet needs . make small changes one would suspect anything rules change benefit . finally get help enemy state . democrats n't done things , guess need get ball republicans ... .this ... ..shit !"

Donald Underwood?,"Hi,


So I’ve been following the press titles regarding the Supreme Court judges and Trump. I didn’t really understand it really. Tried to read some articles but none of them is “non-US-citizen- friendly”. Can someone explains what happened exactly, and how is that affecting the elections? The reason why I’m asking is that I’m in the final episodes of House of Cards S05 (not gonna see S06) and there are lots of similarities between the psychopaths that are Trump and Francis underwood. 

Their manipulative, anti-social (in the psychological context) personality made it hard for me to ignore the fact the House of Cards is actually predicting what’s gonna happen in the near future.

We need to get rid of Mitch McConnell NOW more than EVER.,"Look, Mitch McConnell was a hindrance to democracy before last week but right now we have a chance to retire him once and for all. I'm a field organizer for Amy McGrath's campaign and we have been talking to Kentuckians all summer and for much longer before that about what they need in their representative. They need someone with integrity who stands up and acknowledges that Kentucky is worth fighting for.

This race has never been closer and we have a real fighting chance but we can't do it without help. In the age of COVID, voting has never been safer or easier but many of our neighbors don't know how to vote. We will be calling Kentuckians every day from now until the election on November 3rd to inform them on how to vote and to tell them what Amy stands for, Amy is counting on us. Making phone calls and having one on one conversations is the most effective way of securing someone's vote and support.

Here below is the link to all of our Phonebank Timeslots coming up (they are in EST). If you have any questions or have any other way you would like to help, please shoot me a private message. Thank you for your time!

"Looking For Veterans to Stand Up, To Remember Their Oath, To Support And Defend",">tl;dr: I'm a combat vet. I watched American citizens and reporters get beaten and gassed illegally. I watched it be done by local police, military, and federal forces. I got pissed off. I started protesting for the first time. Accidentally started a veteran organization. 3 months later we're growing and the need is bigger than ever. My eyes have been opened and I can't unsee the travesty occurring in our country right now. Now we need your help. [Volunteer here.](https://www.continuetoserve.vet/get-involved) [Our website here.](https://www.continuetoserve.vet)

&#x200B;

On June 1st, I watched something I had never personally witnessed. I watched people, citizens, reporters, journalists, photographers, peacefully protesting or doing their jobs reporting the news, be beaten, gassed, and shot with rubber bullets. I had blackhawks hovering over my house and a city I have come to love and call home was flooded with thousands of federal officers and military personnel. It was a small taste of what martial law would be like. And as a combat veteran, as someone who has lost people overseas in what I now believe were useless and unnecessary wars, I did not sign up, deploy, and lose friends, my mental health, my own family upon my return, so that I could watch a President utterly destroy the very fabric our nation was founded on.

On June 2nd, myself and a fellow veteran I deployed with went to BLM Plaza to stand in solidarity with the BLM movement and for the rights of all Americans to protest and exercise their 1A right to free speech. We stood because we believed that the military should never be used on US soil to silence a free people with rights. This is not the America I grew up believing in. So we stood. 

Having never organized before, having never gone to a protest, I had no idea what to do or what to expect. We've now been out there for 3 months. Standing with, supporting local BLM grassroots orgs, and now we are on the brink of establishing our own 501c3 to continue our mission. We are Continue To Serve, a veteran-based nonprofit, focused on social justice issues and community service. We stand for the rights of all citizens and intend to remember our oath to support and defend the Constitution and the citizens it represents. 

I'm not asking for donations. I am asking for something more valuable, we need your time, your energy, your expertise. Veterans, please join us in standing up for what is right and calling out what is wrong. We are a direct action organization, but in time, we are planning on establishing training and education platforms, community service support systems, and we will expand into more than just the BLM Movement and the Vote. There are many issues that need our attention and veterans can no longer sit idle and stay quiet. We must stand. Please join us. No matter where in the country you are, we can use your help.

Roberts, or any of the other conservative judges, can stop that by resigning, denying Moscow Mitch his power grab prize. They know this is blatantly unfair.

Senate candidates to (and to not) donate to,"After the passing of Ruth Bater Ginsburg I'm sure many of us are worried about the future of the Supreme Court, so here's some senate campaigns to throw some money to, and some to not do that with 

**WHO TO NOT DONATE TO**

Amy McGrath of Kentucky 
I loath Mitch McConnell, but if polls are any indication, McGrath can not win, it is not worth it to spend money on this race, it's sad, but the next best thing to replacing McConnell is making him lose control of the senate 

Doug Jones of Alabama 
It pains me to say this, but Jones is losing, there's not anything that can be done about it. Alabama is red as hell and it's just a waste of money. I love Jones and wouldn't trade his last three years representing Alabama for anything, but it was always borrowed time. (I'm hoping he gets picked for Attorney General)

John Hickenlooper of Colorado 
Full stop, Gardner is done, Hickenlooper will win in Colorado no matter what, which is good because it's more money to other senate races

Mark Kelly of Arizona 
Mark Kell is up against McSally, BY DOUBLE DIGITS. Kelly has all the money he needs, this seat is another safe Dem pickup 

**WHO TO SEND MONEY TOO**
Sara Gideon of Maine https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ads-sg-feb?refcode=ads-190701-gs-evergreen_dtd-natl-searchers_brandedkeys-ad1-sara gideon&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2aa_79Sceea4kEwu7sN_8oTI5z4BaMeIKalj1NqFzR33fGDxv6DVWQaAljmEALw_wcB
Susan Collins has to go and Gideon needs all the help she can get. Polls are good but too close for comfort

Cal is in a single digit race against Tillis in what is most likely the tipping point of the senate, we win this, we have the senate thanks to Harris

Gary Peters of Michigan https://secure.actblue.com/donate/peters_ads?refcode=ads_gs_branded_d2d_nat&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2avY2rR9NSEDaD5kqyZxoP37ckSnnH0PKjQRNXgTMrmSUIzcQAN65AaAogqEALw_wcB
We do need to defend seats and the only non-Alabama one I'm worried about is Peters, his opponent has out raised him on past quarters and I'd rather he not win. Please keep my home state blue

Steve Bullock of Montana https://secure.actblue.com/donate/scb-ads-200423-search-dd?refcode=ads_search_200423_steve bullock_ad4_461969414615&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2ZQgUfFPkTDhyM1nSZP15tRPROGduHdEHWceTqSVq_YMS6EBs6snRYaAs0xEALw_wcB
Bullock is our best senate recruitment of this cycle. He is the popular term limited governor of Montana and the only one who can win this seat for dems, please donate.

Joni Ernst is currently one of the peast popular senators and we have a real chance at taking this seat, Greenfield can do it, once again, please donate 

Jon Ossoff of Georgia https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_fr_ossoff_q32019_dd_senateblue_a?refcode=MS_AD_D-DD_2019.09.09_X_GG_KW__X__eyJjcmVhdGl2ZSI6IkZsaXAgR0EgQmx1ZSIsImF1ZGllbmNlIjoiT0ZVU1MifQ&recurring=TRUE&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2bytQ4YXZ_8Wf5uhU6uc1AN3EHQj3-9w6SSKqxE5-9zEqn4D2NwCVMaAjR4EALw_wcB
Remember him? Well after losing a house race he is currently running for senate in the swing stage of Georgia, and he's neck and neck with his opponent. We can win this race!

Rev. Ralph Warnock of Georgia (special) https://secure.actblue.com/donate/wfg_ads-a?amount=25&amounts=25,50,100,250,500,1000,2800&refcode=ads_alw_gs_brand_d2d_nat_tCPA&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2aeoNNmWvK0x6b7ZAWEG3UI4RZBnZyfxA__bgG7z9MkjFpqtDOB2YUaAtgTEALw_wcB
Guess what? Both of Georgia's senate seats are up and the best dem to flip this one is Warnock, who has overtaken Liberman in polls for the top dem in this race. Please donate and pray we don't get locked out of this race.

Jamie Harrison of South Carolina https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_harrison_fr_q12019_jaime-a?refcode=MS_AD_D-DD_2019.03.08_X_GG_KW__X__eyJjcmVhdGl2ZSI6IkpvaW4gSGlzIFRlYW0iLCJhdWRpZW5jZSI6IkhhcnJpc29uRm9yU2VuYXRlIn0&recurring=TRUE&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2YHDld1f-m4HLanjJ3lSr3dS0mzZl4ej5uceRWEZUFP_FSWxR40f04aAjXREALw_wcB
A poll came out that has Harrison TIED with Lindsey Graham! Graham needs to go and Harrison can do it. This is a better investment then Kentucky, please donate 

**WHO TO MAYBE GIVE MONEY TO**

Dr. Al Gross of Alaska 
https://secure.actblue.com/donate/algross-2020-q3search?gpsid=35_111_14220&refcode=gpsGLSad20_200730_srchfr_d2d_gq_ntlinfoskr__&utm_campaign=gpsGLSad20_200730_srchfr_d2d_gq_ntlinfoskr__&utm_medium=ads&utm_source=agros&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2ZEQ-v9Gqz2LLfG_2C4xCw7sN101fY5yoDeKl8RVeV_a8rgW0kpCIsaAswCEALw_wcB
Alaska may be red but it's also very independent and that's who Gross is, and independent with the backing of the democratic party. Polls shows a race with many undecideds but ultimately this is a long shot. If you want to, give the good Doctor some moeny

Dr. Barbara Bollier of Kansas https://bollierforkansas.com
Another doctor and another long shot. While Kobach is unfortunately not her opponent, polls still show a close race. I wish we had more but until then she's not a bad investment 

Mike Espy of Mississippi https://espyforsenate.com
Another long shot but a possible pickup if we're lucky. He came close in the special election in 2018 so here's to hoping he wins.

MJ Hegar of Texas https://mjfortexas.com
Texas is trending blue, and while Cornyn is not as disliked as Cruz, he is also not as well known. Polls aren't the best but there's a possibility here. Fingers crossed

A simple truth: Republicans Must Cheat,"It’s a simple truth: Republicans can’t win if they don’t cheat 

The past two rep presidents didn’t win the popular vote. George bush won when Florida (run by his brother Jeb) said they miscounted the votes and it was too close to call. Then W (from an oil family) sent America to war with a country based on the lie that they had weapons of mass destrucion. Iraq never did.  They had oil which we annexed and they had death for thousands of Americans. Bush lied. Got what he wanted and thousands died. 

Donald also didn’t win the popular vote. He won when Russia interfered in the election and got him the win. This, in addition to years of gerrymandering districts to benefit republican outcomes and making it virtually impossible for low income citizens to vote in republican urban areas got him the win. Now he has assigned one of his largest financial donors to run the post office to manage mail in ballots. For the epidemic, Donald  admitted he lied to the American people that it was not so bad. He lied and hundreds of Thousands more Americans died. 

The republican head of the senate blocked the assignment of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee for a whole year saying it was too close to an election to vote. And now with less than two months to an election he is trying to force one in. Cheating. They make third grader excuses and say everyone does it and keep doing it. They ignore congressional subpoenas because they know they would be convicted. They suppress and attack scientific facts because they know their extremist beliefs are wrong. Cheating. 
The Republican Party can not win anything on a fair playing field so they cheat. Consistently. Year after year so they can get what they want at the expense of the rest of the country. 

They are so far from American Law and freedom they make the Taliban look like missionaries.

Hope in the midst of darkness,"Fellow Democrats,

Be brave!

We are facing the greatest challenge since World War II, we stand in the midst of darkness. The pandemic is taking countless lives due to the greatest dereliction of duty by a President in the history of America and those who follow him. The economic consequences will be felt for years to come as will the grief for every American lost. There will be a need to care for those who will have suffered permanent damage to their lungs and hearts. Not to mention the psychological trauma this period will have caused on thousands of Americans. Children all across America will need all the support we can give them to get them back on track in school, young adults will need support to get their careers back on track. All this as we must, absolutely must, tackle the crisis of global warming head on.

Be full of Hope!

I am full of hope, even as we stand in the midst of darkness, while the Republicans are clawing their hooks into the Supreme Court, and the pandemic rages on, I am full of hope. 

I am hopefull because people all across America have had it. They've had it with draconian Republican policies that no longer are tolerable. The republican party has been leaning on anti abortion, anti health care, anti financial aid, anti LGBTG  rights, anti climate and anti truth for too long and people have had it. People have had it with republican cronyism and self dealing. People have had it with the President and the Senate who serve themselves and wall street over the stakeholders of this nation.

Work arduously!

We are ahead in crucial senate races, in particular in Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado. When we win those races we take the senate. Recent polling shows we are competitive in Alaska, Montana, Kansas, Texas, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina. Let's us get right on it because America deserves better, America wants better.

This is the election were we beat back the darkness, this is the election were we retake the senate, the presidency and keep the house and get this nation back on track. 

Sleep sound at night knowing that there is hope in the midst of darkness and wake to work for the change America needs.",1,"hope midst darknessfellow democrats , brave ! facing greatest challenge since world war ii , stand midst darkness . pandemic taking countless lives due greatest dereliction duty president history america follow . economic consequences felt years come grief every american lost . need care suffered permanent damage lungs hearts . mention psychological trauma period caused thousands americans . children across america need support give get back track school , young adults need support get careers back track . must , absolutely must , tackle crisis global warming head . full hope ! full hope , even stand midst darkness , republicans clawing hooks supreme court , pandemic rages , full hope . hopefull people across america .

Democrat Agenda for first 100 days,"There is no doubt that the Republicans have been re-writing rules to allow them to maintain their minority rule (evidence in stacking federal judges after refusing hearings with Obama, stealing the Garland seat and then reversing with RBG). Here are my thoughts on what the democrat administration needs to do to restore democracy. This assumes Biden wins and we take back at least 50 seats in the Senate.

1. Get rid of the filibuster. Republicans aren't interested in norms or rules and the dems should stop playing by the old rules. In order to restore order to the republic with reform, this rule needs to go.
2. Term limits on Supreme Court judges. I know a lot of folks talk about packing the court, but the challenge is the death spiral this creates. When republicans get power back they'd just do the same, so we'd go from 9 to 11 to 13 and so on. Term limits could accomplish the same goal. If set at 16 years, effective immediately, it would boot Thomas, Robert and Altito- along with Breyer. This would give the dems a 5-4 advantage in the first term. 
3. Statehood for DC and consider splitting California into two states. Red states have way too much power overall, relative to population. The only way to level this playing field is to add to the field. By adding 2 - 4 safe democratic seats, the senate will be more reflective of the US population.
4. Get rid of the electoral college. Small population center states votes count more than dense states. The electoral college is the only reason republicans have won in the recent past. Every vote should be equal in the presidential election.
5. New voter rights laws, including federal rules restricting Gerrymandering. Clearly the dems need to restore voter rights that the Supreme Court knocked down. But, in addition, we have to stop the blatant gerrymandering. I'm not sure the answer, but the crazy shapes to ensure a democrat or republican victory have to go. Gerrymandering allows for more 'safe' districts where a party can run an extreme candidate and win. This encourages more and more extreme candidates that aren't beholden to the people because they can't be voted out. Get rid of this and we can reduce extreme politics (and maybe, just maybe the parties will start working together occasionally).
6. New laws on the media to make them accountable for their reporting. Opinion shows rule the cable news network and Fox has no journalist integrity. Hannity will report on conspiracy theories like they are fact and then does not retract when they are proven false. There has to be penalties for spreading false information without equal time retracting the information (on the same show). This should extent to FB, BTW.

&#x200B;

Once you have all of this done, the democrats need to move fast on health care, tax reform and corruption laws. But without the above done, we'll be hanging from fingertips every 2-4 years.  Government needs to work for the people, not the few, special interests and the rich.

The Mississippi Senate might just be competitive,"The Mississippi Senate might just be competitive according to this latest poll. The Republican Incumbent (Cindy Hyde-Smith) is up by only 1 point. Looking at the polling, there is an obvious trend which can be seen. Mike Espy is gaining ground. Around May, the margin was 28 points, but since then, all polls indicate that the race is tightening up and is now within reach.

I know the likelihood of Mike Espy winning in Mississippi are low, even with the polls and all. But this just shows how a Blue wave is coming to drown Moscow Mitch and his henchmen.

Are Trump campaign fundraising emails and texts illegal?,"**TL:DR**

My understanding is that fundraising practices for political campaigns are pretty heavily regulated. So my question is: is the Trump campaign using illegal practices, and if so, why is no one taking it to court?

**Details**

I thought it would be interesting to sign up for Trump emails and texts. Interesting it was, but also kinda scary. And more specifically, full of lies and deception. Beyond being angry about this (somehow it really boiled my blood that he's taking advantage of his own supporters), it really seems like it should be illegal to lie in your campaign fundraising. I'm especially interested in verifying these ""700% match"" claims. Here are a few specific example snippets (with real name redacted):

Texts:

There Isn’t Much Reason to Believe a Supreme Court Opening Will Help the Trump Campaign, ,1,’ much reason believe supreme court opening help trump campaign
Hmmmm I wonder what they’ll do now though,"Not that they actually care. 

“2016, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait to the next election.”

2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): “I don’t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.”

2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): “The very balance of our nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.”

2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice.” 

2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): “The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.”

2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): “In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.” 

2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.”

2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.”

2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): “I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.”

2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): “I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.””",1,"hmmmm wonder ’ thoughnot actually care . “ 2016 , sen. ted cruz ( r-texas ) : “ 80 years since supreme court vacancy nominated confirmed election year . long tradition ’ election year. ” 2018 , sen. lindsey graham ( r-s.c. ) : “ opening comes last year president trump ’ term , primary process started , ’ wait next election. ” 2016 , sen. marco rubio ( r-fla. ) : “ ’ think moving nominee last year president ’ term - would say republican president. ” 2016 , sen. david perdue ( r-ga. ) : “ balance nation ’ highest court serious jeopardy . member senate judiciary committee , everything power encourage president senate leadership start process hear american people. ” 2016 , sen. chuck grassley ( r-iowa ) : “ lifetime appointment could dramatically impact individual freedoms change direction court least generation important get bogged politics . american people ’ denied voice. ” 2016 , sen. thom tillis ( r-n.c. ) : “ campaign already way . essential institution senate health republic launch nation partisan , divisive confirmation battle time american people casting ballots elect next president. ” 2016 , sen. richard burr ( r-n.c. ) : “ election year , american people opportunity say future direction country . reason , believe vacancy left open justice antonin scalia filled new president. ” 2016 , sen. roy blunt ( r-mo . ) : “ senate confirm new supreme court justice new president. ” 2016 , sen. cory gardner ( r-col. ) : “ think ’ close election . president elected november one makes decision. ” 2016 , sen. rob portman ( r-ohio ) : “ believe best thing country trust american people weigh make lifetime appointment could reshape supreme court generations . ’ unusual . common practice senate stop acting lifetime appointments last year presidential term , ’ nearly 80 years since president permitted immediately fill vacancy arose presidential election year. ” 2016 , sen. ron johnson ( r-wisc . ) : “ strongly agree american people decide future direction supreme court votes president majority party u.s. senate . ” ”"

"Could a Democratic House and Senate (with some help) impeach and convict Trump between Jan 3 and Jan 20, 2021?","I don't think this is a likely scenario. But is it possible? Nothing about the next few months is going to be typical, all kinds of shenanigans may happen. Many Democrats in power appear to have realized that restricting their strategies to any honored conventions other than the actual law and Constitution puts them at disadvantage to aggressive Republican tactics.

Winners of the November 2020 election will be sworn in on these dates:

New senators are sworn in Jan 3, 2021.

Source: [Wikipedia - 2020 US Senate elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_Senate_elections)

New representatives sessions also start Jan 3.

Source: [Wikipedia - US House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives)

BUT, any new president would not be inaugurated, until January 20, 2021.

Source: [Wikipedia - US Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election)

ERGO: From January 3, 2021 until January 20, 2021, there would be a window of time where a Democratic majority in the House and Senate could both impeach President Trump - even if Trump was a lame duck president.

Granted a Senate conviction even with a Democratic majority would be difficult, given the need for 2/3 votes to convict. But as the majority, Democrats would have new power to highlight Trump's impeached behavior and pressure or persuade Republican's to help.

Last note: If Trump were convicted in January by the Senate, but had won the election, his ability to take up office on January 20, 2021 would still depend on a separate vote by the Senate on whether to prevent him from ever being able to hold office again. That would seem certain after a conviction given a Democratic majority and this quote from the source below:

Feasibility of gaining Senate seats via coordinated liberal conquest of Wyoming,"I was thinking about the rural/urban Dem/Rep divide and the the news that Bloomberg would front $100M to win Florida when I had this idea. Hear me out!

A Dem-leaning billionaire/highly-funded organization makes a proposal: If you are a Democrat-leaning person living in a urban state interested in securing more blue seats in the Senate this organization will subsidize to some degree your relocation to Wyoming, a very red state with a 2020 population of 578K people

Some issues I expect with this are:

* finding enough liberals willing and able to move from a blue state to Wyoming
* the cost involved in subsidizing the massive migration

Suppose these were not problems. Would this work? 

This is a little tongue-in-cheek but a little serious. I'm interested to hear what other people think or if anybody else has written about this.

This Is What Republicans Previously Said About Appointing SCOTUS Justices During An Election Year,"**Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO):** “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.” 

**Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC):** “In this election year, the  American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the  future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy  left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a  new president.” 

**Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX):**  “I believe the American people deserve to have a voice in the  selection of the next Supreme Court Justice, and the best way to ensure  that happens is to have the Senate consider a nomination made by the  next President.

Confirming a new Supreme Court Justice during a presidential election  year for a vacancy arising that same year is not common in our nation’s  history; the last time it happened was in 1932. And it has been almost  130 years since a presidential election year nominee was confirmed for a  vacancy arising the same year under divided government as we have  today.""

**Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX):** “It has been 80 years since a  Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year.  There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

**Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA):** “We will see what the people say this fall and our next president, regardless of party, will be making that nomination.” 

**Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO):** “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision."" 

**Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC):** “If an opening comes in  the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has  started, we’ll wait to the next election” 

**Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA):** “A lifetime appointment  that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the  direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get  bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a  voice.” 

**Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND):** “There is 80 years of  precedent for not nominating and confirming a new justice of the Supreme  Court in the final year of a president’s term so that people can have a  say in this very important decision.” 

**Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK):** “It makes the current  presidential election all that more important as not only are the next  four years in play, but an entire generation of Americans will be  impacted by the balance of the court and its rulings. Sens. Barack  Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid have all  made statements that the Senate does not have to confirm presidential  nominations in an election year. I will oppose this nomination as I  firmly believe we must let the people decide the Supreme Court’s  future.” 

**Sen. David Perdue (R-GA):** “The very balance of our  nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the  president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear  from the American people.” 

**Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH):** “I believe the best thing  for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who  should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court  for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the  Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a  presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president  was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential  election year.” 

**Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL):** “I don’t think we should be  moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term — I would  say that if it was a Republican president .” 

**Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC):** “Vice President Biden’s  remarks may have been voiced in 1992, but they are entirely applicable  to 2016. The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the  institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not  launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during  the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to  elect our next president.” 

**Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA):** “The next Court appointment should be made by the newly-elected president.”

"The best way to immediately continue RBG’s fight is by donating to Mark Kelly, regardless of what state you live in, as he can be sworn in on November 30th as it is a special election.","I believe Dems have enough procedural powers to slow down the process until after the election. If Trump loses and Republicans lose the senate, ole Moscow Mitch will still try to jam a nomination down America’s throat. Judicial nominees(all appointed positions) has been Mitchy’s game for over a decade.

Mark Kelly is currently favored by 538’s model 78/22. This election by far is a Dems best chance of unseating a Republican. Right now Dems need 4 Republicans to break rank to defeat the Republican senate. If Mark wins, Dems only need 3. It looks like Republican senators in Maine and Alaska will not vote with their party before the election or after if Biden wins. It’s likely that Dems could pick up 1 more if Biden wins.

Further, he is the wife of Rep. Gabby Gifford who was shot while in office, a combat pilot, and an astronaut. Decent resume if I do say so. Plus, he would fill the seat of late Sen. McCain who we all saw do the right thing with his vote to repeal Obamacare.

Obviously this all hinges on Biden winning, but it’s the easiest thing we can do right now while on Reddit before we can formulate a full strategy now that the election has changed. 

Finally, donate to all Dems that you believe in or that we need. This is a suggestion if you have limited funds and you want to get the best bang for your buck. 

Disclaimer: I live in WA and I do not work for nor am I affiliated with the Kelly campaign. I love political strategy and the law. I graduated with a Poli Sci degree and then went on to law school and passed the bar exam.

A Catalog of Hypocrisy,"2016, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait to the next election.”

2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): “I don’t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.”

2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): “The very balance of our nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.”

2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice.” 

2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): “The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.”

2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): “In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.” 

2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.”

2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.”

2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): “I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.”

2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): “I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.”

2016, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky)

Increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court to reverse GOP court packing and how to message about it,"Everyone needs to start recognizing and talking about the fact that the GOP has been packing the courts, including the Supreme Court, for the past 10 years.

If the Democrats win the Presidency and Senate in November there will be a big push from the base to abandon the filibuster and increase the number of seat on the Supreme Court to pack it with left wing judges. This was already talked about before RBG died, and will be absolutely necessary if Trump and McConnell fill her seat. Obama talked about dropping the filibuster during his speech at John Lewis's funeral. The idea isn't new.

What we need to start doing NOW is preparing the ground rhetorically for increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court. The media, the GOP, and politically non-engaged people will decry this at cheating, and court packing. We need to start preparing to counter this argument.

The fact is that the GOP has been court packing ever since 2012. If increasing the number of seats on a court and filling them with like minded judges is court packing, then so is preventing existing seats from being filled under the Constitutionally proscribed process because the person filling them would appoint judges you don't like until a like minded President is elected to fill those seats.

Mitch McConnell packed the Supreme Court when he prevented Obama from naming a replacement for Scalia's seat. He packed the lower courts when he spent 6 years blocking judicial appointments. The past decade of GOP control of the Senate has seen the most egregious court packing in US history. Democrats increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court and lower courts isn't court packing, it's reversing the court packing the GOP has been practicing for a decade.

Everyone should write their Democratic Senators and Senate candidates and express this view. Don't ask them to pack the Supreme Court. Ask them to increase the seats to reverse the court packing the GOP has gotten away with. Frame it like this every single time you talk about it.",1,"increasing number seats supreme court reverse gop court packing message iteveryone needs start recognizing talking fact gop packing courts , including supreme court , past 10 years . democrats win presidency senate november big push base abandon filibuster increase number seat supreme court pack left wing judges . already talked rbg died , absolutely necessary trump mcconnell fill seat . obama talked dropping filibuster speech john lewis 's funeral . idea n't new . need start preparing ground rhetorically increasing number seats supreme court . media , gop , politically non-engaged people decry cheating , court packing . need start preparing counter argument . fact gop court packing ever since 2012. increasing number seats court filling like minded judges court packing , preventing existing seats filled constitutionally proscribed process person filling would appoint judges n't like like minded president elected fill seats . mitch mcconnell packed supreme court prevented obama naming replacement scalia 's seat . packed lower courts spent 6 years blocking judicial appointments . past decade gop control senate seen egregious court packing us history . democrats increasing number seats supreme court lower courts n't court packing , 's reversing court packing gop practicing decade . everyone write democratic senators senate candidates express view . n't ask pack supreme court . ask increase seats reverse court packing gop gotten away . frame like every single time talk ."

The AvengeHer Plan,"(First, abolish the filibuster.)

1. The lower circuit courts of appeals have a wild disparity in number of judges in relation to population. The 11th circuit has one judge for every 2.7 million people while the 10th circuit has one judge for every 1.4 million. This should be made uniform, 1 judge for every million people in a circuit, with a circuit capped at 21 judges with a minimum of 11. Every ten years after the census the courts should be expanded to account for population growth.
2. That means that there should be approximately 332 appeals court judges not 179. This should be spread over 16 circuit courts not 12 plus the Federal and DC Circuit courts which should be brought up to the maximum of 21 judges. This means we need to confirm 172 new appeals court judges to bring population balance to the appeals courts.
3. The Supreme Court use to have a judge to account for each circuit court. Today each Supreme Court Justices is assigned a circuit court to cover with some having to cover multiple courts. This is an unreasonable burden to place on the justices so the court should be expanded so there is one Supreme Court justice for every circuit court.
4. That means there should be 18 Supreme Court Justices and we'll need to confirm an additional 9 justices to meet the requirements of the new law. Every ten years after the census a Supreme Court member will be added to account for any growth in the circuit courts.

We will be establishing some much needed equal representation to the circuit courts and returning the Supreme Court to its traditional role of representing the size of the circuit courts. It's a reasonable plan based on tradition and equality of representation.

"RBG’s passing, upcoming election, and possible reddit election fund for democrats?","Hey guys, 

I’m a 22 year old from Columbus Ohio, I’ve been a democrat my entire life (basically since I understood basic civics education and economics, my family also leans left), I fall between moderate and progressive. With Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s untimely and disappointing passing and upcoming election, I was wondering if we can make an election fund in order to support the democrats who are running for congress, senate, local elections and etc. In particular, this fund can help support those who are in critical/close-call races. Another republican pick to the supreme court maybe disastrous to this country in the long term, there needs to be a balance in the highest court of the land, and hopefully some republicans follow their set principles from 2016 and block a new nominee appointment before the 2021 inauguration. Now more than ever, we need leaders who have a progressive mindset and want to create honest change and can push our country to further heights, this fund should allow that to take place.

Please let me know if this is a good idea, if you guys are interested, and if the moderators are also interested.

Is there anyway we can do this, or does this already exist? I was hoping maybe the Moderators can take a look and maybe create some sort of fund for us to donate to!

"Congratulations to MN, VA, SD and WY! Starting today you get to vote out Trump!","---
#VOTE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE
---
####Mail-In Voting aka Absentee Voting

As of today, MN, VA, SD and WY join PA in beginning early voting to defeat the most dangerous President in history. Make no mistake, this is the most important election of our lives. Nearly all states have expanded mail-in voting eligibility to all citizens, with most states automatically mailing ballots or ballot applications to everyone. If you have not received one, [request your absentee ballot now.](https://www.vote.org/) Nearly all states have waved any requirements for witness/notary for mail-in ballots this election, **however MO has not!** If you live in MO, make a plan now on how to safely vote. (If you know of any other states that have restrictions on voting, please share details in the comments.)

####In-Person Voting

Early voting has begun! Most states are strongly discouraging in-person voting this election due to the pandemic. Check your local state's websites to see if in-person early voting is still available, as many states have switched to mail-in ballot drop-off only. If you choose to vote in-person, first check your voter registration, polling place and any other voting requirements in your state such as an ID. [Currently, most states can request and some require a form of ID to vote in-person.](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx)

####Register to Vote

Voter registration is still open for all 50 states. The first states begin closing voter registration starting Oct 4th, so don't wait! If you haven't yet, now is the time to register, and get your friends and family registered too: https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/

####Election Protection

If you experience harassment, intimidation, or anyone trying to prevent you from voting, report it to Election Protection Hotline (866-687-8683) immediately. No matter what, under federal law you always have the right to cast a provisional ballot, so there is no reason not to try and vote. Make sure you're at the right polling location: in 27 states, if you cast a provisional ballot at the wrong polling location, your vote will not be counted.

"Democrats = make some noise! Stop turning other cheek and ""taking the high road""","""Now is the time to rise up"" may sound cliche - but it fits. I encourage fellow Democrats make their voices heard loud and clear going into this final run to the election.

First, I'd like to see *much* more of Biden giving performances like last night town hall. He needs to be everywhere. So does Harris. Trump clearly has an unfair advantage of consistent exposure. We need to do everything we can to help match that.

What can you do?

* DONATE to Biden/Harris or your local fav. ANY amount is welcome.
* PUT UP THE SIGN in your yard and the sticker on your car.
* CORRECT MISINFORMATION / false statements in conversations (but check your emotions).
* Get other Dems to register and VOTE.
* Don't be afraid to SPEAK THE TRUTH on social media (and make sure it is the truth).
* VOLUNTEER any time you can to the candidate of your choice.

The Republican Party - or what's left of it - is a loud and misguided organism. It's time we made the noise of truth to match.

I was just push-polled from Pennsylvania,"I was just push-polled from Pennsylvania.  Even though I live in Seattle I still have the same Pittsburgh cell number I've owned for 20 years.  Some highlights of the call:

* Cold call from a Pittsburgh Area code (412)
* Caller spoke perfect English but had an Indian accent. He was extremely polite and spoke loudly and slowly
* Asked for me by firstname, middlename, lastname  Only about 4 people on Earth know my middle name.  I wonder if this gives insight into how they got my info. 

I told him that I was no longer available at this number but that I love surveys and would gladly take one. 

* He asked me some basic questions regarding if I am registered and if I plan to vote in 2020
* Asked if I was ""locked in"" to my choice or if I could have my mind changed
* Asked how locked in I felt I was

(He very specifically used the word ""party"" for everyone but Trump)

* Asked who I was thinking of voting for.  List of candidates went Dario Hunter, Green Party; Joe Biden, Democratic Party; Donald J Trump, Republican; Jo Jorgensen, Libertarian party

* Favorability of Biden
* Favorability of Trump
* Favorability of Pelosi
* Policy details on a favorability scale. A typical kind of question would be

> Very favorable, Somewhat favorable, Neutral, Somewhat unfavorable, very unfavorable: Instituting a tax plan that would raise taxes on every American while damaging the economy and harming small business

* Questions were primarily economic focused
* Opinion on the favorability scale of ""Hunter Biden and the Biden family using lobbying money and Russian bribes to enrich themselves at the expense of the American people.""

* Opinion on favorability scale of Donald Trumps performance as president
* Opinion on direction of the country
* Opinion on direction of the economy
* Opinion on Trumps economy performance
* Opinion on Trumps security performance
* Opinion on Trumps wildfire performance
* Opinion on Trumps Coronavirus performance
* Which candidate would do better on Defense, which on economy, which on Coronavirus, which on environment, which on corruption

(I thought this next one was strange)

* If you had to choose between two candidates, A and B, where A was a nice guy who means well but was an ineffective lifetime politician, leader of a corrupt family and in bed with a liberal agenda and B was not the nicest person but always had the best interests of the American people at heart and could project strength while keeping the economy strong, which would you pick?

* Favorability of different tax policy propositions. The propositions basically involved ""A a tax plan that would [do very bad sounding things]"" (for stuff that was obviously Biden or ""This proposal that would [do very nice sounding things] "" (for stuff that was obviously Trump)

* Would you vote for a candidate who was going to attack social security and healthcare benefits, and enact policies that would put many Americans over 75 on the street, including those making less than $30K a year

* Once again, who are you planning to vote for in November.
* How certain are you about that vote
* Demographic data - since I told him I wasn't me he took my full name, age bracket, income bracket, urban/suburban/rural, ethnicity, marital status
* Who did you vote for in 2016

TBH I'm not sure how anyone falls for these.

Edit: I have been getting hammered with solicitations from both parties.  Democratic stuff is usually a text message asking me to vote. They usually come in at supremely annoying times about 4-5am for me.  Republican stuff is through the phone mainly but rarely through text.  Phone stuff are polls.  I get polled about 2x weekly now.  I get a text usually during primetime for sports. The texts are almost always guilt trippy. 

I was registered dem from 2004-2016, switched to independent after 2016 primary.  If anyone on the Biden campaign is interested reads this sub, I get a lot of these and I could record them for you.

Edit 2: I almost wonder if this was a low key GOTV call for wavering 2016 Trump voters. I'm shocked they mentioned Hunter Biden when the Trump clan is corrupt to its nepotistic core. I was also surprised they didn't bring out the Supreme Court arguments.

Is there a Democrat/Leftist version of this??? This is literally so ridiculous.,"""GASLIGHTING  
===========  
The term originates in the systematic psychological manipulation of a victim by her husband in Patrick Hamilton’s 1938 stage play Gas Light, and the film adaptations released in 1940 and 1944. In the story, the husband attempts to convince his wife and others that she is insane by manipulating small elements of their environment and insisting that she is mistaken, remembering things incorrectly, or delusional when she points out these changes. The play's title alludes to how the abusive husband slowly dims the gas lights in their home, while pretending nothing has changed, in an effort to make his wife doubt her own perceptions. The wife repeatedly asks her husband to confirm her perceptions about the dimming lights, but in defiance of reality, he keeps insisting that the lights are the same and instead it is she who is going insane.  


We are living in a perpetual state of gaslighting. The reality that we are being told by the media is at complete odds with what we are seeing with our own two eyes. And when we question the false reality that we are being presented, or we claim that what we see is that actual reality, we are vilified as racist or bigots or just plain crazy. You’re not racist. You’re not crazy. You’re being gaslighted.  


New York State has twice as many deaths from Covid-19 than any other state, and New York has accounted for one fifth of all Covid-19 deaths, but we are told that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has handled the pandemic better than any other governor. But if we support policies of Governors whose states had only a fraction of the infections and deaths as New York, we’re called anti-science and want people to die. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


We see mobs of people looting stores, smashing windows, setting cars on fire and burning down buildings, but we are told that these demonstrations are peaceful protests. And when we call this destruction of our cities, riots, we are called racists. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


We see the major problem destroying many inner-cities is crime; murder, gang violence, drug dealing, drive-by shootings, armed robbery, but we are told that it is not crime, but the police that are the problem in the inner-cities. We are told we must defund the police and remove law enforcement from crime-riddled cities to make them safer. But if we advocate for more policing in cities overrun by crime, we are accused of being white supremacists and racists. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


The United States of America accepts more immigrants than any other country in the world. The vast majority of the immigrants are “people of color”, and these immigrants are enjoying freedom and economic opportunity not available to them in their country of origin, but we are told that the United States is the most racist and oppressive country on the planet, and if we disagree, we are called racist and xenophobic. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Capitalist countries are the most prosperous countries in the world The standard of living is the highest in capitalist countries. We see more poor people move up the economic ladder to the middle and even the wealthy class through their effort and ability in capitalist countries than any other economic system in the world, but we are told capitalism is an oppressive system designed to keep people down. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Communist countries killed over 100 million people in the 20th century. Communist countries strip their citizens of basic human rights, dictate every aspect of their lives, treat their citizens like slaves, and drive their economies into the ground, but we are told that Communism is the fairest, most equitable, freest and most prosperous economic system in the world. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


The most egregious example of gaslighting is the concept of “white fragility”. You spend your life trying to be a good person, trying to treat people fairly and with respect. You disavow racism and bigotry in all its forms. You judge people solely on the content of their character and not by the color of their skin. You don’t discriminate based on race or ethnicity. But you are told you are a racist, not because of something you did or said, but solely because of the color of your skin. You know instinctively that charging someone with racism because of their skin color is itself racist. You know that you are not racist, so you defend yourself and your character, but you are told that your defense of yourself is proof of your racism. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Gaslighting has become one of the most pervasive and destructive tactics in American politics. It is the exact opposite of what our political system was meant to be. It deals in lies and psychological coercion, and not the truth and intellectual discourse. If you ever ask yourself if you’re crazy, you are not. Crazy people aren’t sane enough to ask themselves if they’re crazy. So, trust yourself, believe what’s in your heart. Trust your eyes over what you are told. Never listen to the people who tell you that you are crazy, because you are not, you’re being gaslighted.

What a Democratic House Leadership could look like in 2021,"This is an interesting situation. Speaker Pelosi has held her speakership for 3 terms now. To become the 52nd speaker to pledged to limit herself. So she might not become speaker, but if she wants it, she’ll probably get it. But with Assistant Speaker Lujan most likely becoming Senator for New Mexico, and the growing calls for a change in Democratic House Leadership.

(Sidebar: The current top 3 for the democrats in the house are all over 80, but they all won’t leave at the same time. So I believe from the 117th Congress there’ll be changes)

Let’s all be honest here, the democrats will maintain control of the house. Whether they win the Senate or the Presidency is to be determined. Nonetheless, the top 5 will change. Whether Biden wins or not (I believe he will), Rep. Richmond, currently assistant to the Majority Whip, will become the majority whip, even more so if Biden wins as his influence will exponentially rise in Washington. Rep. Jeffries will move from Caucus Chair and Rep. Clark (currently Vice-Chair) will most likely take over. Rep. Jeffries might move to Majority Leader, with Rep. Hoyer (currently Majority Leader) to Speaker. Rep. Bustos (currently DCCC Chair), might move to Assistant Speaker or they’ll have a more progressive here.

But I suspect 117th House Democratic Leadership will look like:

Speaker of the House - Rep. Steyn Hoyer

Majority Leader - Rep. Hakeem Jeffries

Majority Whip - Rep. Cedric Richmond

Assistant Speaker - Rep. Cheri Bustos

Caucus Chair - Rep. Katherine Clark


W.r.t. Rep. Schiff, he’ll remain HPSCI Chair or become DNI if Biden wins. There’s also talk he might run for Senate as Sen. Feinstein would most likely not run for re-election. But that’s going to be a crowded field, from Gov. Newsome to CA Sec of State Padilla to CA AG Beccera, maybe even the Lt. Gov. Kounalakis. As I do think, under the presumption of Biden/Harris winning, Rep. Bass would take Harris’ seat or at least a minority female will be replacing her.

The other progressives in the Democratic Caucus are young and need some years in the House before they move into leadership. I give them 2/3 terms before their moves into House Leadership.

With Rep. Pelosi and Rep. Clyburn out, I still believe they’ll be advising the new house leaders in their roles to help them along the way until they retire from the house, which would be within the next 4 years.",1,"democratic house leadership could look like 2021this interesting situation . speaker pelosi held speakership 3 terms . become 52nd speaker pledged limit . might become speaker , wants , ’ probably get . assistant speaker lujan likely becoming senator new mexico , growing calls change democratic house leadership .

"Today on Senator McCain's funeral,only one living president is not invited : Donald Trump. Till this day he didn't apologize to McCain's family or the POWs for trashing all those members in uniform who were captured and tortured by our enemies.","In an Op-Ed in today's NYT ""Straining to Keep Faith with America"" Bret Stephens has trashed Trump in no uncertain terms by adding this in his piece ""John McCain knew that we are better than Trump.""

To that I like to add my own thoughts saying that maybe, I emphasize the word ""maybe"" again to say that maybe a healthy Senator McCain could put a stop to a marauding president called Trump. 

But with the Republican Senator John McCain's death, there is nothing that can stop Trump from destroying each and every American values that this country developed over two centuries plus more.

Even a Republican president Ronald Reagan's description of America was much different from Trump's vision.

By quoting a phrase from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Reagan declared that our country is like ""a shining city on a hill"".

But since Trump took over the presidency, every Americans are ""straining to keep Faith with America"", the country they love dearly unlike Trump and his followers who only think of what they can get. 

Even Democratic president John Kennedy's words on his inauguration on January 20th, 1961, ""Ask not what your country can do for you_ask what can do for your country"", have no sway over the minds of these fake ""swamp cleaners"" like Trump. 

Trump is more interested in finding how much money he can milk from his presidency than giving some of his assets to the countrymen who were really struggling everyday to keep their faith on America.

Their struggles to keep faith on our institutions are four hundred times more now than before Trump took office on Jan 20th, '17.

That is the reason why we've to feel sorry for John McCain's permanent absence from an institution, mainly the Senate where he grilled each and every Trump's appointees and his cabinet members to hit hard at Trump's illogical policies.

Trump on the other hand didn't have the decency to go to McCain before his death or to his wife and families now to apologize saying, ""I should've never said that I don't care for people like you who got captured at war. As you know I didn't go to Vietnam for my bad foot. But I really appreciate your pains and sufferings due to terrible tortures at the hands of the Vietcong guerrillas. I'm really sorry that you endured those tortures for five plus years just to keep our country safe. May God bless your soul.""

Pragmatism is the name of the game when it comes to the GE; not nit-picky purity tests. Otherwise, staying home, or write-ins, or other forms of protesting the winner of the Dem primary because he/she was not your first choice just ensures another 4 years of Trump. 

There are 20 people running who I'd personally like to see occupy the the WH over its current inhabitant. We can't win the race when we're so set on fighting amongst ourselves.",1,"gentle reminder democratic votersthere 20 dems running primary . means 19 *will* lose . early , late ; put good fight , others much . sure , one may chosen vp candidate , understand , chances first choice guy/gal race likely lose . pragmatism name game comes ge ; nit-picky purity tests . otherwise , staying home , write-ins , forms protesting winner dem primary he/she first choice ensures another 4 years trump . 20 people running 'd personally like see occupy wh current inhabitant . ca n't win race 're set fighting amongst ."

"Please help fellow Democrats, first time voter here having trouble registering to vote in my state! Which I need to do ASAP to vote!!!!","I am a SC resident with a valid drivers license. After finding out that I was actually still registered to vote in NC - where my absentee voter ballot was sent to- I went online today to attempt to register in my current state of SC so that I can actually vote.  Given my license number and social security number, the website located my DMV resident address in SC and it was correct. It then asks previous registration state (NC), and previous registration county (Mecklenburg). The next prompt is where it has lost me. 

The website lists in clear, capital red letters “DO NOT ENTER YOUR RESIDENCE ADDRESS AS YOUR MAILING ADDRESS”. What on earth would I list, if not my resident address? I don’t think I can use my parents home as mailing address, because they are in NC. I can’t move on to the next step until I list this “mailing address” that is NOT my resident address. 

Please forgive my ignorance, but I want to vote! Can anyone help me figure out how to proceed with this? I’ll go in person (masked, obviously)  if I need to to vote, but I know I have to be registered first!

I don't know where else to post this,"I had to write out my thoughts after last night. It hurt to watch so much and I wanted to know why. I hope it's okay if I pay this here.

Jesus Christ - the debate was miserable. Trump did nothing but bully somebody trying to stay on topic. To add to that, he decided to say the election can't be trusted and that - basically - the Proud Boys should ""guard"" the polls. Fuck Trump. He deserves a major epic-scale loss on election day. And after that, prison. I want to see justice. Can you believe that in 2020, I might lose my right to healthcare, people can be jailed again for abortions, and that the right to same-sex marriage can just suddenly go back to ""not being a thing."" Memphis is my hometown. I grew up in the south. That city and that region molded a lot of who I am, for better or worse, and even I can see the terrifying tragedy of the moment. Half the country has lost it's ability to care about it's fellow citizen. Does Obamacare actually harm you? Does Roe v Wade actually harm you? If you change your perspective for five damn seconds you realize that there's nothing at stake for you. But, when it comes to ""liberals"" like me, we stand to lose the right to healthcare and are subject to exploitation and abuse by profit-driven health ""care"" companies. We stand to lose hope that people of color can actually witness empathy from a government who has killed them for centuries. We stand to go back to draconian times where women would have to hide and risk their lives so they can have one at all. We stand to lose a simple basic right that two people should be treated fairly under the rational definition of marriage. Tell me, please, what do Republicans have at stake? Zoning laws? A lop-sided, unfair court? The right… not to choose? I struggle to see love from you, Republicans, and I include my family in that. You cannot say you care and then smile as you watch what keeps me alive collapsing. You are selectively sociopathic, able to compartmentalize when love is appropriate and when it gets in the way. Churches across this country are filled with you. Seats meant for active compassion filled by cold, fear-driven hearts. I'm not a fan of guns at all, yet somehow I can talk with gun owners (because I actually believe it's more bi-partisan than the NRA wants you to know.) But, somehow the cult huffing the Trump-glue do not see me as a fellow American, and the thing I'm struggling with is that I'm beginning to feel the same way about you, those who vote Trump. This isn't a good thing and it's only going to get darker as the storm clouds of Trump descends on the festival by the river. He'll do his damndest to make sure the waters rise higher and higher, drowning all who attend, regardless of beliefs, regardless of loyalty, regardless of spirit. He is anti-love.

About Trump mentioning Biden’s son,"As someone who has grown up in a household full of addiction, and struggled with addiction myself, Biden showed pure empathy, understanding, and humbleness when he admitted his son used to be an addict. He didn’t have to, it was a private manner unrelated to the election, and yet he owned up to it. It sent chills down my spine and almost brought a tear to my eye when he said what he did about it. Never have I witnessed a politician be human and admit faults. 

Trump can’t even own up to his tax records, and Biden was able to swallow his pride and set the record straight. 

I was undecided before this debate (I knew I wasn’t voting trump, but was considering third party) but after hearing Biden last night, I know who I’m voting for.",1,"trump mentioning biden ’ sonas someone grown household full addiction , struggled addiction , biden showed pure empathy , understanding , humbleness admitted son used addict . ’ , private manner unrelated election , yet owned . sent chills spine almost brought tear eye said . never witnessed politician human admit faults . trump ’ even tax records , biden able swallow pride set record straight . undecided debate ( knew ’ voting trump , considering third party ) hearing biden last night , know ’ voting ."

YSK that Trump's debate tactic has a name: Gish Gallop,"[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish\_Gallop](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop)

The **Gish Gallop** is the [fallacious](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy) [debate](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Debate) tactic of drowning your opponent in a flood of individually-weak [arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument) in order to prevent rebuttal of the whole argument collection without great effort. The Gish Gallop is a conveyor belt-fed version of the [on the spot fallacy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/On_the_spot_fallacy), as it's unreasonable for anyone to have a well-composed answer *immediately* available to every argument present in the Gallop. The Gish Gallop is named after [creationist](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Creationist) [Duane Gish](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Duane_Gish), who often abused it.

Although it takes a trivial amount of effort on the Galloper's part to make each individual point before skipping on to the next (especially if they cite from a pre-concocted list of Gallop arguments), a refutation of the same Gallop may likely take much longer and require significantly more effort (per [the basic principle](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Entropy) that it's always easier to *make a mess* than to clean it back up again).

The tedium inherent in untangling a Gish Gallop typically allows for very little ""creative license"" or vivid [rhetoric](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rhetoric) (in deliberate contrast to the exciting point-dashing central to *the Galloping*), which in turn risks boring the audience or readers, further loosening the refuter's grip on the crowd.

This is especially true in that the Galloper need only [win *a single one* out of all his component arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/One_single_proof) in order to be able to [cast doubt on the entire refutation attempt](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/FUD). For this reason, the refuter *must* achieve a 100% success ratio (with all the yawn-inducing elaboration that goes with such precision). Thus, Gish Galloping is frequently employed (with particularly devastating results) in timed debates. The same is true for any time- or character-limited debate medium, including [Twitter](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Twitter) and newspaper editorials.

Gish Gallops are almost always performed with numerous other logical fallacies baked in. The myriad component arguments constituting the Gallop may typically intersperse *a few* perfectly uncontroversial claims — the basic validity of which are intended to lend undue credence to the Gallop at large — with a devious hodgepodge of [half-truths](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lying_by_omission), outright [lies](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lie), [red herrings](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Red_herring) and [straw men](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man) — which, if not rebutted as the fallacies they are, pile up into egregious problems for the refuter.

There may also be [escape hatches](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Escape_hatch) or [""gotcha"" arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gotcha_argument) present in the Gallop, which are — like the Gish Gallop itself — specifically designed to be brief *to pose*, yet [take a long time to unravel and refute](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/One-way_hash_argument).

However, Gish Gallops aren't impossible to defeat — just tricky (not to say near-impossible for the unprepared). Upon closer inspection, many of the *allegedly stand-alone* component arguments may turn out to be [nothing but thinly-veiled repetitions or simple rephrasings of the same basic points](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/PRATT) — which only makes the list *taller*, not more correct (hence; ""proof *by verbosity*""). This essential flaw in the Gallop means that a skilled rebuttal of *one* component argument may in fact be a rebuttal to *many*.",1,"ysk trump 's debate tactic name : gish gallop [ https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/gish\_gallop ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/gish_gallop ) **gish gallop** [ fallacious ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/logical_fallacy ) [ debate ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/debate ) tactic drowning opponent flood individually-weak [ arguments ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/argument ) order prevent rebuttal whole argument collection without great effort . gish gallop conveyor belt-fed version [ spot fallacy ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/on_the_spot_fallacy ) , 's unreasonable anyone well-composed answer *immediately* available every argument present gallop . gish gallop named [ creationist ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/creationist ) [ duane gish ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/duane_gish ) , often abused . although takes trivial amount effort galloper 's part make individual point skipping next ( especially cite pre-concocted list gallop arguments ) , refutation gallop may likely take much longer require significantly effort ( per [ basic principle ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/entropy ) 's always easier *make mess* clean back ) . tedium inherent untangling gish gallop typically allows little `` creative license '' vivid [ rhetoric ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/rhetoric ) ( deliberate contrast exciting point-dashing central *the galloping* ) , turn risks boring audience readers , loosening refuter 's grip crowd . especially true galloper need [ win *a single one* component arguments ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/one_single_proof ) order able [ cast doubt entire refutation attempt ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/fud ) . reason , refuter *must* achieve 100 % success ratio ( yawn-inducing elaboration goes precision ) . thus , gish galloping frequently employed ( particularly devastating results ) timed debates . true time- character-limited debate medium , including [ twitter ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/twitter ) newspaper editorials . gish gallops almost always performed numerous logical fallacies baked . myriad component arguments constituting gallop may typically intersperse *a few* perfectly uncontroversial claims — basic validity intended lend undue credence gallop large — devious hodgepodge [ half-truths ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/lying_by_omission ) , outright [ lies ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/lie ) , [ red herrings ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/red_herring ) [ straw men ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/straw_man ) — , rebutted fallacies , pile egregious problems refuter . may also [ escape hatches ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/escape_hatch ) [ `` gotcha '' arguments ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/gotcha_argument ) present gallop , — like gish gallop — specifically designed brief *to pose* , yet [ take long time unravel refute ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/one-way_hash_argument ) . however , gish gallops n't impossible defeat — tricky ( say near-impossible unprepared ) . upon closer inspection , many *allegedly stand-alone* component arguments may turn [ nothing thinly-veiled repetitions simple rephrasings basic points ] ( https : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/pratt ) — makes list *taller* , correct ( hence ; `` proof *by verbosity* '' ) . essential flaw gallop means skilled rebuttal *one* component argument may fact rebuttal *many* ."

Should the Democrats pursue partitioning certain states in order to elect additional Senators?,"The Democrats have structural disadvantages in the Senate, which leads to disadvantages in appointing Supreme Court Justices and other judges. In 2018, for example, Democratic Senate candidates collectively beat Republicans by a large margin, but the Republicans still gained seats in the Senate.

Democrats could work to bridge the gap by partitioning blue states. California, New York, and Massachusetts could likely each be partitioned in such a way that the states are still safe Democratic states, potentially leading to six more Democratic Senators. If DC is granted statehood as well, that could lead to eight more Democratic Senators. (I feel Puerto Rico should be offered statehood if the population agrees, but I believe it's presumptuous to assume their Senators would be Democrats.)

Partitioning efforts have been frequent in California, with the most recent proposal in 2018. New York saw proposals for partitioning Long Island as recently as 2010. Massachusetts hasn't had any serious proposals in the recent past, so that may be more of a long shot.

YOU can help fight voter suppression!,"We are constantly telling people to vote, but we rarely help spread information ABOUT the process of voting. It's important that we make sure people are knowledgeable about and prepared for voting! 

Here's a list of things you can do to help everyone make sure their voices are heard in the upcoming elections:

1. Make sure you're registered to vote and show people how they can easily check online. Here's one way to check: [https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote/voter-registration-status](https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote/voter-registration-status)
2. Know your state's voter laws! What identification do you need, does your state accept absentee voting without excuse, etc. Know if there's any tricky rules/mishaps that can get your ballot discarded! Do you need a security envelope? Find out!!
3. SHARE your state's voter info!!! On any platform you can, with whoever you can! Make sure your community's voice is being heard. 
4. Host zoom parties to help people fill out ballots together. You can research and answer questions together, so that less mistakes are made and many questions can be answered at once!
5. Become a poll worker! There is a shortage of poll workers right now, and you could be PAID. 

The most important part of voting in this election is being prepared to vote, so let's help people prepare instead of just saying""vote vote vote"" over and over. Too many people's voices have been lost because they've shown up to elections and found out they aren't registered or because they signed in the wrong place on their ballot. YOU can help by speeding the word and getting involved, which is something you can do from home!

Don't Know Where Else To Say This,"Watched the debate like most everyone else here, and I don't know where else to go to post my opinion on this. 

Long-time Republican from a family of Republicans. Grew up in NC in a well-off family. Always voted down party lines, but mostly because I was too lazy to actually look up what the candidates stood for. In 2016, voted for Trump because I felt that he could fix the economy with his business experience (I was hit particularly hard from the great recession) and because Hillary was shady as shit (mostly because of what happened with Benghazi). I figured ""hell at least he's better than her, what's the worst he could do?""

Flash forward to some time around 2018 when I was reading about Trump's connections to Russia and his actions just started to make sense. I realized that ""this guy is going to get us all killed or at best turn all of our allies against us, and that's exactly what our enemies want. Of course Russia supports him and China is silently fighting the trade war on their terms...they want him to self-destruct us!""

So, I started considering not voting for Trump again, and voicing this to my family. My wife thinks I'm crazy. She thinks he does no wrong and the bad things that happen in our country just happen and no one could have done anything better. There is always an excuse for why things aren't Trump's fault or it's ""fake news"". I honestly can't tell if she is actually batshit crazy or I am anymore. 

Watching the debate tonight, it was so refreshing hearing Biden act like a fucking normal president would. I feel like our country is already in such a worse place than it was 4 years ago, and I live in a part of the country that is pretty Red. It's such a sinking feeling in my stomach to think of Trump being re-elected. I know I can only cast my vote once and can't control what others do. Feels bad. 

Sorry for the soap box, not sure where else to write all this that won't get downvoted into oblivion.

Edit: Forgot to mention that when I talk to my wife about voting for Biden she says ""says the guy who voted for Trump"", like can I not change my mind now? Is that not allowed? Can I not say I made a mistake and if I knew then what I know now things would be different?

A Suggestion To The Biden Campaign Managers (And to anyone raising money and text banking),"""Hey it's Kamala.  Doesn't Joe remind you of what a president should be like on the debate stage?  Joe's on stage with Trump right now, and we have to show him our support.  We set a goal to raise $5.2M from texts like these before Wednesday, and we're relying on supporters like you to help make it happen.  Will you chip in $12 now?""

Why would you send out a text that containing lies (Joe did not perform particularly presidentially, and saying that Kamala sent the text is just silly) and then ask me for money?  Do you really expect a text like that to do anything but annoy people?  

I gave you money before because I believe that Democrats fight for the facts and fight to give the most people better lives.  I'm guessing that's true of many other Democrats.  How can your campaign more effectively embody that to both raise support and raise the money you clearly so urgently want?

By providing value.  

How?

Use the numbers that you have collected to provide your supporters with facts to counteract the lies being told on-stage.  That certainly doesn't mean sending a text every minute, but rather calling out the boldest of Trumps lies and providing us with sources that prove it.  Preferably ones that are as unbiased as possible and not just news articles or words from Biden's website.

By doing this, you demonstrate your belief in truth and provide supporters with effective resources to point others to and reduce the spread of false information.  In addition, I might start thinking ""Wow, they're really putting my money to good use!  Maybe I should donate more and help them.""

To anyone who reads this, please point out any flaws in the idea.  It is totally possible that I'm just ignorant of how campaigns and text banking works or not thinking things through fully.  

If you like the idea, let's work together to find out how to improve campaign activities so we can win this goddamn election.",1,"suggestion biden campaign managers ( anyone raising money text banking ) '' hey 's kamala . n't joe remind president like debate stage ? joe 's stage trump right , show support . set goal raise $ 5.2m texts like wednesday , 're relying supporters like help make happen . chip $ 12 ?

I stuck with who to vote for.,"I believe in capitalism, low taxes and focus on managing the budget, and I believe that we need law enforcement to stop the riots and to have someone from outside the police department to do investigations involving their officers. I 100% disagree with defunding or bringing a social worker with a official to a shots fired call. I believe the officers need to be more transparent with their rules of deadly force as what I learned from criminal justice involving deadly force gave me a completely different view of how these bad innocent situations happen. 

I also believe in lgbt rights as I’m gay. I don’t care if your homophobic that’s your life but it should not prevent me from living mines.

I believe Americans have to right to buy a weapon as gun violence is increasing we need to protect ourselves. Background check need to be a must. We need to fund officers to do their job as some police departments don’t have enough funding to protect their community to stop these wrongful gun owners.

My inspiration is Robert Kennedy as he was like me who wanted to end division as he said:

 “We can move in that direction as a country, in greater polarization - black people amongst blacks, and white amongst whites, filled with hatred toward one another. Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand and to comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand, compassion and love.... What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.”

Registered to vote,"Hey guys. I’m located in Texas and I’m 20 years old. 2 years ago I had registered to vote for the Texas senate  and since, I have moved to a new house. I still live in the same county (just 4 minutes away from my previous home) and i got a registration form in the mail (it has my current address) but i don’t know if I’m supposed to sign in (and make any changes to it) and mail it back or if I’m not supposed to change anything and leave it as it is.

Does anyone know somewhere I can volunteer to help drive (ideally Democrat) voters to the polls in Pennsylvania?,"I've been trying to find somewhere to volunteer to help drive people to the polls on election day in Pennsylvania.

I live in North Jersey and we are 100% vote-by-mail thanks to Murphey. I signed up to be a poll worker but I don't think I'm getting any response since the few polls that will be open are primarily just places to drop off your mail-in ballot. 

I've been trying to find some place to volunteer to help drive people to the polls in PA since it's a swing state but it's almost impossible to find an organization organizing it. The website for Drive the Vote is gone with no info, Carpool Vote is still functioning, but that's mainly to help drive one or two people along your path to vote.

The best one I can find is rideshare2vote.com but the closest state they are active in is West Virginia. Does anyone know of any local democratic party  or organization organizing rides to the polls in PA? Otherwise I think I might just take the 4-5 hour drive to West VA the night before Nov 3rd to help there.

I've also been letter writing and phone banking but I want something I can do to be directly involved on election day, and ideally somewhere I can make a difference, which is why I was looking at PA.

Does it ever get better?,"I’m a young democrat- as in 2016 was my first election. At the time, it felt like we were fighting tooth and nail for the dignity of our country and our quality of life/rights. When the results came in in 2016,
I was an emotional wreck for a while. Obviously many of my fears came true, and my life has gone from wonderful and fulfilling to an isolated nightmare. Now it feels like we’re fighting for the same things as in 2016- except the stakes are even higher and even more lives are on the line.

So I want to ask of “older democrats”- does it ever get better? Is every presidential election such a desperate and exhausting fight to protect each other? Or is Trump an exception. Bearing the emotional weight of an election of this calibre of importance every four years is something that feels impossible.

I appreciate anything you guys have to say.

Help an Aussie to Understand,"Hey all, Aussie with a thought/questions and looking for some feedback. Before I begin I want to be clear this will be post both here and over at r/Republican assuming moderators from both sides are comfortable with the introspection.

So, whenever one of your political leaders is shown to have done something even their peers find reprehensible (Trump's Ukraine call, Hillary's private email server), the immediate reaction is a whataboutism attacking either the other leader or even just a dubious individual or group from across the aisle. This essentially confirms the disapproval of the favoured leader's actions, otherwise the actions would be plainly defensible outright, no?

This just seems so dopey yet 9/10 its the go-to response, and I know there are smart cookies on both sides. We don't do this to the same degree over here and if anything the party leader is crowned king dipstick and most open to criticism. Your candidates just seem to have ethical rap sheets that could circumnavigate the globe, with any item seeming ripe for disqualification. Both parties have had respectable leaders in the past and most people know somebody in their personal lives they respect - so this is possible. My thinking is that if dems/republicans were more critical of their leaders they might actually build an environment for worthwhile candidates to rise, which might then lead to candidates more palatable to voters across the political spectrum? If ever I had the chance to vote for a respectable candidate of any political leaning that wasn't dripping slime I'd jump at it. Seems like a cut the nose off to spite the face approach to me, or at least spite the other team.

So truly, what's going on here? At first I'd guess it's a compassionate understanding that we all make mistakes, but when it only really applies to one's team captain I'm left stumped.

*Disclaimer: Because it is sure to matter, most of our Aussie politicians from the major parties are spineless centrists so I am not heavily invested in either team. Regardless of the current candidates I don't believe my aligned values of integrity, fortitude and equality are the exclusive property of either US party.*",1,"help aussie understandhey , aussie thought/questions looking feedback . begin want clear post r/republican assuming moderators sides comfortable introspection . , whenever one political leaders shown done something even peers find reprehensible ( trump 's ukraine call , hillary 's private email server ) , immediate reaction whataboutism attacking either leader even dubious individual group across aisle . essentially confirms disapproval favoured leader 's actions , otherwise actions would plainly defensible outright , ? seems dopey yet 9/10 go-to response , know smart cookies sides . n't degree anything party leader crowned king dipstick open criticism . candidates seem ethical rap sheets could circumnavigate globe , item seeming ripe disqualification . parties respectable leaders past people know somebody personal lives respect - possible . thinking dems/republicans critical leaders might actually build environment worthwhile candidates rise , might lead candidates palatable voters across political spectrum ? ever chance vote respectable candidate political leaning n't dripping slime 'd jump . seems like cut nose spite face approach , least spite team . truly , 's going ? first 'd guess 's compassionate understanding make mistakes , really applies one 's team captain 'm left stumped . *disclaimer : sure matter , aussie politicians major parties spineless centrists heavily invested either team . regardless current candidates n't believe aligned values integrity , fortitude equality exclusive property either us party . *"

Trump bringing up Hunter Biden’s drug use history is a new rock bottom for American Politics,"In the entirety of that shitshow that we the American people have to call our “presidential debate”, Trump mentioning the drug use and mental health history of Hunter Biden was by far my least favorite part. If you look more into the history of the life Hunter Biden has lived, he was in a car crash where he lost his mother and younger sister, and suffered a childhood brain injury. He then lost his only remaining sibling from Joe’s first marriage to brain cancer when Beau Biden passed in 2015. He has had anything but an easy life, and as someone who personally has had some struggles with substance use I found this to be disgraceful. How can we ever get past the mental health stigma when our president thinks someone’s child’s addiction is a means to discredit them in an argument? Especially when it’s so obvious as to why Hunter happened to turn to drug use? I knew trump was a disgrace, but this is a new low.",1,"trump bringing hunter biden ’ drug use history new rock bottom american politicsin entirety shitshow american people call “ presidential debate ” , trump mentioning drug use mental health history hunter biden far least favorite part . look history life hunter biden lived , car crash lost mother younger sister , suffered childhood brain injury . lost remaining sibling joe ’ first marriage brain cancer beau biden passed 2015. anything easy life , someone personally struggles substance use found disgraceful . ever get past mental health stigma president thinks someone ’ child ’ addiction means discredit argument ? especially ’ obvious hunter happened turn drug use ? knew trump disgrace , new low ."

Pledge Request,"I Pledge to give the Biden Campaign $5 for each day that Trump is in the Hospital due to his own Careless and Destructive Leadership.

Please Join me.

Hopefully this is permissible in the community.  In any case, I'm serious.  I've already given more to Biden / Lincoln Project / Jaime Harrison than I've ever given to anyone during an Election year, but I can do a bit more.

Based on the number of people now coming out of that Rose Garden ceremony with positive tests, there were probably a WHOLE BUNCH of already infected people at the event, which assured that there was active virus all over the place for a very effective spread.

And why?  Because trump has led in a culture of unconcern about the reality and seriousness of the virus, and it is HIS LEADERSHIP that created this destructive situation.

Just wait till his lies about Climate Change (and so many other issues) become (more) clear.

He needs to go.

"Opinion and Proposition: To ensure a speedy recovery from the coronavirus, President Trump should resign from office","I read earlier today that [Twiter will start suspending users wishing for Donald Trump's death after being diagnosed with COVID.](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitter-suspend-users-wishing-trump-dead-1234791263/)  I think this is valid, as COVID is a very dangerous disease that is devastating to a person's health and very painful, and could lead to death.  In fact, I encourage the opposite:  I wish Trump and other members of government including senators, representatives, cabinet members, and cabinet secretaries who are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus a speedy recovery and return to health.

But, running for office and running the government must be so incredibly stressful and exhausting, and complicated to do from a hospital bed.  On NPR yesterday, they said that Trump prefers receiving his security briefs in person, and being isolated in the hospital could complicate how the President receives his security briefings with his staff.

But I propose that President Trump need not worry about security briefs, and the other duties of president, by *resigning from office*.  Resigning from the Presidency will allow him to focus on getting better and healthy while he fights COVID.  He will need all of the strength that God can give him to battle his deadly disease.  Because, what's more important for President Trump?  That he die from COVID, or survive so that he could re-run for the presidency in 2024?  Or enjoying retirement after working so hard serving the country for nearly four years?

I think that any other member of government that also contracts COVID should also resign so they can recover speedily.  And also to prevent other members of government from catching the disease and dying, or being bed-ridden for weeks, possibly months, affecting how our country functions!

I'm not on Twitter or other social media besides Facebook, so please, tweet this message, post it on Instagram, or Snapchat, and all the other social medias:

What has the Trump Administration done with regards to China?,"With the election coming, everyone I've talked to says that China is the biggest threat, and that the Trump Administration is doing lots of stuff against China given what China has done (rebuking them, sanctions, etc).

Putting aside his tweets, I'm trying to find out in good faith what exactly has the administration done with regards to China and their recent activity? I guess I'm trying to understand why China 'should be #1' in my list of concerns when voting, as others have mentioned.

Chill Out with the whole Trump faking Covid Conspiracy,"I'm not saying it's beneath team Trump to pull a stunt like that, BUT, we have to look at the facts and really ask, ""Is it even surprising Trump contracted Covid?"" I mean really, the guy almost never wears a mask or social distances and comes into contact with dozens of different people every day. The only parts of this that are hard to believe is that 1) Trump didn't catch it sooner 2) Melania got close enough to him to catch it (of course, entirely possible she got it from someone else or same person Trump did).  


It's VERY hard for me to believe that Trump would fake an illness so close to election day when he Knows he is losing. He loves getting out there and campaigning, it's literally one of the only things he truly enjoys as president, you think he'd willingly give that up for two weeks just before an election. And finally, despite what the general public thought, Trump thinks he killed it at that debate He was very likely looking forward to the next two, not looking for ways to get out of them.  


Remember too, that the White House didn't announce Hicks was positive, a reporter scooped it. If anything, the White House was going to try and keep this a secret.

"Democrats: if we want to consign the GOP to the electoral dustbin of history, we need to change the way we talk about abortion. Now is the absolute best time to start","I encourage everyone seeing this to read [this excellent piece](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/02/trump-suburbs-white-women-michigan-423870) from Tim Alberta about Elissa Slotkin's Michigan district. It’s a long piece, so I’ll quote the relevant part:

>When Slotkin’s speech wrapped up, I got to talking with two middle-aged women who were sitting in lawn chairs. **Rachel Babich and Karen Kudla both described themselves as longtime Republicans whose loyalty to the party owed largely to the issue of abortion.** Both are teachers—Kudla is now retired—and both are moms. Despite being offended by Trump four years ago, neither of them could bear to vote for Hillary Clinton.

>“I’ve been a single-issue Republican, a pro-life voter, for a very long time. But Trump changed my thinking in that regard,” Babich explained. **“I’ve had it with this idea that you’re only pro-life if you fight against abortion. I’ve come to see there’s a much better way to be pro-life, and that’s making sure our social programs are funded, making sure our climate crisis is dealt with, making sure DREAMers are being protected. That’s pro-life, too.”**

>Kudla jumped in. **“What about day care? What about paying good wages? What about helping women support their babies? Those are pro-life policies. And we don’t hear anything about them,”** she said. “Shame on us. Shame on us. I’m a devout Catholic; I pray the rosary every morning. I am so conflicted about all these things. But I cannot in good conscience vote to keep this man in the White House.”

>“Look,” Babich sighed, “I would love to see abortion not be practiced. But I would also love to see women supported to the point where they never have to make a choice between an abortion and a job, an abortion and living in poverty, an abortion and being left behind by society. I don’t want unborn children being killed. It’s awful. But **I can’t think of a more anti-life policy than to put a poor woman in a position where she has no options, where a pregnancy traps her into a life of poverty she can’t escape.”**

The way, by and large, that we Democrats have long talked about abortion -- as a question of pro-choice vs. pro-life -- creates two major, and connected, structural disadvantages for anyone with a D next to their name. First, it buys into the Republicans’ framing of the issue, enabling them to gin up enthusiasm with it almost at will, to the point where Democrats are often afraid to even mention it. But furthermore, it cedes *substantial* emotional ground to the GOP in the eyes of voters like these two. As has been said here and elsewhere, if you think abortion is murder then you’re almost never going to support a candidate who isn’t opposed to it.

But buying into the frame of abortion as allowing it or banning it almost *forces* those voters to go for the GOP, because they will likely suffer some degree of emotional trauma (“I’m supporting a baby-killer?!”) if they don’t. Therefore, **I propose we shift our focus** from talking about whether abortion should be legal to **why women get abortions,** and how we can **reduce the number of abortions performed,** a framing of the issue voters like the two women above can absolutely get behind.

An obvious first part of how you accomplish that is with properly funded education and contraception. These should absolutely be on any Democrat’s platform, and it is for many of them. But there is a much more salient line of advocacy, especially to pro-lifers: **many women have abortions because they simply cannot afford to support a child.** Unintended pregnancies are [**five times more common** for women living in poverty compared to those with middle or high income.](https://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2019/05/who-are-the-1-in-4-american-women-who-choose-abortion/)


The Republicans, with their constant opposition to policies like paid family and sick leave or affordable daycare and healthcare, policies that actually would help to *ease the burden* on women, and on families generally, of having a child, are in fact **indirectly encouraging women to get abortions.** We have all said or heard [variations on the theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvF1Q3UidWM) that Republicans only care about babies before they’re born, and cease giving a damn the moment they start having needs their mother can’t intravenously(?) provide.

So why aren’t we nailing them with that?? *Of course* a poor woman is going to get an abortion if she doesn’t have access to good healthcare to ensure she can stay healthy during the pregnancy, or affordable daycare for when the baby is born, or a job that barely pays enough to feed herself, let alone a whole ‘nother person. Say it again with me: **by denying support for these basic policies and services, Republicans are incentivizing women to abort their babies, because they have made it incredibly costly to have a child.**

This is how we dislodge single-issue abortion voters away from the GOP, just like those two women above are contemplating. The Republicans are happy to bludgeon away at the issue, touting their “pro-life records” as if that actually means anything, all the while having done *nothing*, outside of a few crackpot state gov’t bills, to actually reduce abortions. And in fact, they’re actively increasing them! We should hold them accountable for that!

Democrats should become the *real* “Pro-Life Party”, by supporting policies that don’t corner women into either having an abortion or becoming a parent in abysmal circumstances with the deck *already stacked against the child*. Democrats believe in policies that provide support to both mother and child, regardless of the circumstances, and that support will make **far more gains** in pursuit of reducing abortion than Republicans have ever achieved in over 40 years of blathering about it.

Now this doesn’t mean we’re all of a sudden not going to be supporting safe, legal abortion, and it is still the law of the land, after all. But if we can effectively reframe our language on abortion in this way, it could be a tremendous opportunity to finally go on offense against the Republicans over the *one issue* that has failed to move substantially in our direction over the decades. 

This is a fight Biden can start right now! [Abortion is the top issue for 46% of Trump voters.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election/) I have read piece after piece this cycle about single issue voters who are sticking with Trump only because of the abortion issue. **If Democrats can crack that support group and wedge even a few points away from the GOP, they will cease to be an electable party in this country.** It is time we take the fight to them, and fight for the supportive, practical policies that can make it easier for women to decide in favor of having a child, and in turn make our country and its citizens stronger and healthier.

2021 -universal healthcare approved in lets say Feb.
-Everyone gets there policy by say april 2021
- lets say a child falls and chips break a front tooth requiring a false mold made by dentist ...lets say this happens in May..
-you call a dentist and instead of getting a appointment date you instead would be put on a waiting list ( most likely 6 to 12 months down the line) due to everyone needing and attempting to get work done .. 

This to me sounds ABSURD.. Basically i was told your put on a equvilant of a transplant list and have to wait for you or your minors name to come up..

I was an ardent Trump supporter that has recently switched.,"This is a post I never thought I would ever be making, but here we are. Throughout 2020 i used to be terrified of the “far left” or the “radical left” and that’s why i really wanted Trump.

I along with many in my shoes, have came to a hard realization after this debate. Donald Trump isn’t good for this country. Country over party.

I came to the realization that his whole campaign this year has just been anti-democrat, his whole campaign has been about dividing America, not building it up. This is far different than the Trump of 2016.

My true switch moment happened when Joe Biden called for unity during the debate. That he wanted to work with everybody. Donald on the other hard blamed the democrats for everything, which is against every foundation i have that is America first.

So this is why I’ve switched. I want a president that wants the best for America, not the best for himself or his own party.",1,"ardent trump supporter recently switched.this post never thought would ever making , . throughout 2020 used terrified “ far left ” “ radical left ” ’ really wanted trump . along many shoes , came hard realization debate . donald trump ’ good country . country party . came realization whole campaign year anti-democrat , whole campaign dividing america , building . far different trump 2016. true switch moment happened joe biden called unity debate . wanted work everybody . donald hard blamed democrats everything , every foundation america first . ’ switched . want president wants best america , best party ."
Can’t Register in Florida in time 😞,"I have been living in Florida since February so i meet the criteria to be considered a Florida resident, but i never went to the DMV to officially get my Florida drivers license.

Today I JUST received the documentation i need to be able to register to vote in Florida. I have an appt at the DMV Monday the 5th to become a Florida resident. But, the DMV typically takes 2-3 weeks to send their license. So I won’t get my license in time. And, apparently they can’t print drivers licenses on the spot. 

I don’t suppose anyone has any other ideas?

Update: I called the DMV this morning and they confirmed they issue the license on the spot.  So, I'll just go straight to register afterwards.

I just think it's important that we don't just get distracted by the next scandal, and keep track of everything he's done.

Here's what I have for the month of September so far:

[He's told people of North Carolina to vote twice](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/politics/trump-people-vote-twice.html) 

(Published 9-2-2020)

&#x200B;

[4 Anonymous sources from the Trump administration reported that Trump called American soldiers, who died for their country, ""losers"" and ""suckers""](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/) 

(Published 9-3-2020)

&#x200B;

[His tax returns were released, revealing he only paid $750 in 2016](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html) 

(Published 9-27-2020)

\- This also revealed extremely shady and possibly illegal business right offs.

\- It also revealed the reason why he's under audit: a $72.9 million tax refund that he may have (and like did) fraudulently obtain for ""abandonment"" of a business he was a chairman of.

\- Also, his taxes showed that he has roughly $421 million in debt to some unknown entity. This is a huge conflict of interest and opens him up to be a national security threat.

[Donald Trump refused to condemn white supremacy, told the hate group, Proud Boys, to ""stand back and stand by"", as well as urging his supporters to become illegal poll watchers, all during an incredibly embarrassing debate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&ab_channel=C-SPAN) 

(Published 9/29/2020)

\-[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/wW1lY5jFNcQ?t=5551) Chris Wallace asks if he's willing to condemn white supremacist groups and tell them to stand down. Trump refuses to do so. He says ""sure I'm willing do do that, but I would say, I would say almost everything I see is from the left"", however never does condemn them.

\- [1:33:36](https://youtu.be/wW1lY5jFNcQ?t=5614) Trump says ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by, but I'll you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's gotta do something about Antifa and the left."" Which can easily be interpreted as an endorsement of the group.

\- [1:39:08](https://youtu.be/wW1lY5jFNcQ?t=5948) Trump attacks Biden and his son over his former drug problem.

\- [1:59:19](https://youtu.be/wW1lY5jFNcQ?t=7159) Chris Wallace asks ""Will you urge your supporters to stay calm, during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest, and will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified?"" Donald Trump responded by saying ""I'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully. Because that's what has to happen. I'm urging them to do it."" This is illegal.

&#x200B;

[The following day, Trump denies he knows who the Proud Boys are, and continues to not condemn them.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/01/politics/donald-trump-debate-election-2020-joe-biden/index.html)

"As a Venezuelan, I can say that Trump is using the same dirty strategies that Chavez used to get immoderate power in Venezuela and therefore destroy our country. Here's why","This is something that I suspected since 2015. I'm not a leftist, but I can't endorse a person that promotes divisionism, racism, someone that wants to disrupt democracy and freedom of speech in a country. This guy has been using the same populist and disgusting tactics that Chavez used to fool people and get away with it in his first term.

Yesterday I was watching the presidential debate and I felt a hard pain in my stomach while listening to this a-hole, it was like watching the same guy that brought misery to Venezuela, but on the other side of the spectrum, yet still, both being the same kind of person.

These are some of the things I noticed:

&#x200B;

* This guy wants to do the same as Chavez in the early 2000s with our supreme justice tribunal, fill it with ""loyal"" people that will defend him over the worst cases of crime and corruption.
* Calling the press as ""fake news"" and attempting against freedom of speech to invalidate any kind of criticism or allegations against his crimes, the same as Chavez did, closing the biggest TV channel in Venezuela (RCTV) just because they were pointing out all of the corruption that he was creating.
* Making a Cult out of his followers, fooling ignorant people to support him unconsciously just because the ""other ones"" are bad, saying that he loved the country so much, and telling a bunch of lies about the opposition on TV without showing any kind of proof. But his words were always enough because he was ""the president"".
* Divisionism, trying his hard each day to divide the people as reds and blues, and convince the reds that the blues don't care about them and that they should treat them as enemies  (Chavez would talk about this on national TV for 6 hours straight, every day.)
* treating protestors that opposed him and his acts as criminals and terrorists.
* Promoting homophobia and using ""god"" as a tool for planting his bigoted ideas into his follower's brains.
* Gaining the military and police support by giving them privileges so they can stand by his side.

a clear example that both extremes touch at the end.

these are just a small fraction of what he did and have in mind that this was just his early days, things have gotten 50x worse politically, socially, and obviously economically since then.

This idiot can say anything about that he will overthrow Maduro's dictatorship but those are all lies, they're both basically the same, authoritarians that don't want anything but to remain in power at any cost, and they're both backed up by Russia.

Take this guy out before it is too late. I wouldn't wish all the misery that we've lived to anyone.

People talk about how Biden is clueless and doesn’t know what he’s doing... Trump’s attack on his sons proved otherwise to me...,"Can you imagine someone attacking your dead son’s military service and then switching to your live son’s addiction problem (BTW he WASN’T dishonorably discharged, look it up). If we’re going to personal attacks like that I’m sure fucking a pornstar when your wife just had a kid is worse on a side note. But anyways, If I was Biden at that point, I would be MAD. Like as someone who has not lost a son, but a brother, that would piss me off so much. People talk about how Biden doesn’t know what he’s doing but I am so impressed he was able to keep self-control at that point with the entire nation watching. I certainly would not. The fact that he was able to maintain his calm during that exchange made him a winner in my eyes. And I know that addiction is a prevalent issue in some of these battleground states.

What's the deal with FEC donation deadlines,"I'm sure I'm not alone in getting texted by numerous senators asking for donations ahead of the FEC donations deadline - my question is, is that real or is it just for quarterly reporting data (meaning I can donate like normal tomorrow, but the candidate couldn't report it as a donation this quarter)?  Would love to understand this better.",1,"'s deal fec donation deadlinesi 'm sure 'm alone getting texted numerous senators asking donations ahead fec donations deadline - question , real quarterly reporting data ( meaning donate like normal tomorrow , candidate could n't report donation quarter ) ? would love understand better ."

Today my life-long Republican mother that voted for Trump told me she was going to vote for Biden,"I am just so proud that I needed to share the news! Four years ago, my mother was an obnoxious Trump supporter. So obnoxious in fact that I had to go low contact with her for the first few months following election day and had considered cutting off contact for about a year because she was constantly throwing his win in my face and seemed to deliberately pick fights around Trump and politics.

Well, about 2ish year ago her tune began to change. She said that Trump needed to stop tweeting so much and that he was just constantly sounding like an ass. Slowly but surely she actually seemed to start to dislike the man and was almost as disturbed by the things he said than I was. She eventually said that she just wasn't going to vote at all and I pointed out to her periodically through our conversations the kind of destructive things he was doing, regardless if she agreed with Biden or his policies.

Well, this morning she seemed to make a sudden turn I never expected. She said she was tired of the division that Trump was causing in the country and the hate he was constantly spouting and the only way to stop him was to vote against him. She is going to vote for Biden.

Wow. I never thought it would happen and I thought she would be grasping onto this life raft for the rest of her life until she drowned in the stupidity that Trump seems to represent and attract. But I can proudly say that she didn't let political party history influence her or refuse to admit when she was wrong. So proud!",1,"today life-long republican mother voted trump told going vote bideni proud needed share news ! four years ago , mother obnoxious trump supporter . obnoxious fact go low contact first months following election day considered cutting contact year constantly throwing win face seemed deliberately pick fights around trump politics . well , 2ish year ago tune began change . said trump needed stop tweeting much constantly sounding like ass . slowly surely actually seemed start dislike man almost disturbed things said . eventually said n't going vote pointed periodically conversations kind destructive things , regardless agreed biden policies . well , morning seemed make sudden turn never expected . said tired division trump causing country hate constantly spouting way stop vote . going vote biden . wow . never thought would happen thought would grasping onto life raft rest life drowned stupidity trump seems represent attract . proudly say n't let political party history influence refuse admit wrong . proud !"

If you want to opt-out of being texted, just say “STOP” or “OPT OUT” instead of cussing out the sender and hurling out insults.

"Please help fellow Democrats, first time voter here having trouble registering to vote in my state! Which I need to do ASAP to vote!!!!","I am a SC resident with a valid drivers license. After finding out that I was actually still registered to vote in NC - where my absentee voter ballot was sent to- I went online today to attempt to register in my current state of SC so that I can actually vote.  Given my license number and social security number, the website located my DMV resident address in SC and it was correct. It then asks previous registration state (NC), and previous registration county (Mecklenburg). The next prompt is where it has lost me. 

The website lists in clear, capital red letters “DO NOT ENTER YOUR RESIDENCE ADDRESS AS YOUR MAILING ADDRESS”. What on earth would I list, if not my resident address? I don’t think I can use my parents home as mailing address, because they are in NC. I can’t move on to the next step until I list this “mailing address” that is NOT my resident address. 

Please forgive my ignorance, but I want to vote! Can anyone help me figure out how to proceed with this? I’ll go in person (masked, obviously)  if I need to to vote, but I know I have to be registered first!
