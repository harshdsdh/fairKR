Here's an issue that should unite liberals and the left: Trump's fascistic tactics in Portland. Why aren't we talking about this more?,4,j12duh,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j12duh/heres_an_issue_that_should_unite_liberals_and_the/,2,1601282918,"Many of you already know about this, but for those who don't. Take a look at this timeline of the protests in Portland: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Portland,_Oregon

**June**

* Mostly peaceful, few stories of mild civil unrest
* No request for federal assistance from Mayor Wheeler or Governor Brown
* No constitutional authority for Trump to intervene

**Late June**

Trump issues an executive order to protect statues. Because of course he fucking did. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_deployment_of_federal_forces_in_the_United_States#Founding_of_PACT

This gives him the constitutional excuse he needs to not only assemble a task force of federal agents, but to enter cities where the precious statues might be endangered.

**July**

After the feds get involved, it's just story after story of riots and violence.

**August**

Feds finally pull out, and it immediately gets more peaceful. Not as peaceful as June, unsurprisingly. 

The fucking priorities of this man. In the middle of a pandemic, he issues an executive order to protect statues in order to give himself an excuse to send the federal government into a city against the wishes of the mayor and state governor. He places them directly in the path of the protests, deliberately encouraging conflicts between protesters and the feds. A few kidnappings into unmarked vans later, Trump decided he's collected enough video clips for FOX News and withdraws. Things immediately settle down.

Trump doesn't give a fuck about those statues, but he knows the mouthbreathing conservative culture warriors do. How fucking blatant is that? Everyone on the left and in the center should be outraged by this. Everyone on the right, fuck you.

**edit:**

I think my original post was maybe too focused on the timeline in Oregon, which is important to the story, but not quite as alarming as the executive order protecting statues which is really what makes this whole thing fascist.

Executive Order 13933, Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence, **has been interpreted as allowing federal officers to be deployed without the permission of individual U.S. states.** It's also been used to authorize domestic surveillance.

I don't know how anybody could read about this and not be alarmed. This is without precedent. Don't take it from me, though. [Take it from FOX News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/judge-napolitano-operation-legend-federal-troops-chicago):

>“If the state officials or local officials consent to the introduction of federal assets on the streets and for law enforcement purposes there is no constitutional impediment,” [Judge Napolitano] explained. “But if they don't consent, then there is a constitutional impediment.”

I know we haven't always gotten along, progressives, leftists, liberals, centrists, libertarians, and so on. But please take a long hard look at the base principles of whichever ideology you favor.

I think the vast majority of people who hold those principles should be able to agree on this one thing. Right wingers, you're going to regret this path. Abandon your shit ideology and join the rest of the free world already.

**edit 2:**

The more I think about this, the worse it gets. What that executive order achieves:

1. There is no federal law prohibiting damage to state monuments and statues. There are state laws, but there's no federal law.

2. So the executive order creates a new type of ""forbidden"" behavior that was not forbidden before. Again, it's not a law or a crime at the federal level.

3. It authorizes the creation of a massive federal paramilitary force in order to enforce this new federal prohibition against the forbidden behavior.

4. The force can be deployed into states and cities even against the consent of the state and city government.

5. Destroying statues on state property is already a crime in every state, does that make this less bad? Yes. In a more charitable view, you could say that this is just the federal government enforcing the law on behalf of the state when the state itself refuses to do. Never mind that many cities were actually okay with the statues being destroyed and in many cases even announced that they would take them down themselves.

This will definitely be challenged in the courts, so it may yet be ruled unconstitutional. By the new 6-3 Supreme Court. If they find it constitutional, here's one potential way to state the precedent: ""An executive order can prohibit a behavior and enforce this under threat of violence, even against the will of state and local governments, so long as the prohibited behavior is already illegal in that state.""

This isn't good. One of tactics that city governments use to deal with protests and riots is to basically stop enforcing some petty crimes. Graffiti and minor vandalism particularly, or allowing statues to be destroyed which in many cities actually did a pretty damn good job of calming everyone down.

Now Trump can legally escalate any protest to violence in any American city. No meaningful protest can avoid producing some amount of graffiti, littering, vandalism, noise level laws. He can use it selectively too: aggressive and heavy handed federal involvement at BLM protests, no federal involvement at Proud Boys protests. ""Everyone has been calling these guys 'fascists' but at least they can protest peacefully, unlike the other side.""

This isn't a good path to be heading down. We've seen this before.",9/28/2020 4:48
Fox News and Trump supporters have already decided the New York Times report on Trump's taxes is fake news. Got me thinking....,3,j12d34,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j12d34/fox_news_and_trump_supporters_have_already/,7,1601282832,"A big problem with a lot of remaining Trump supporters is that they're happy enough with their individual lives that they don't see the need for candidates that promote change.

The things that upset them most in their day to day lives are the ""bad"" things they hear about that other people are doing. So they're going to vote for the person they think will stop the ""bad things"".

They are also heavily group focused and do not want to have an opinion that is different from their people. They trust their people and that someone has done the research even if they ""don't have time for that"".

If you had been a part of thier group and you disagree, it's assumed that you're changing groups and becoming brainwashed so your points will be dismissed.

So how do we actually win them over?

I think we have to make them think we're not too different from them whenever possible. And speak only to the things that affect them directly or morally infuriate them.

If they're a one policy voter with abortion- talk to them about how you used to be ""pro life"" too until you read about it and learned that more people are supported in their and their babies lives through the pro choice movement.

If they are worried about their taxes going up and the government being too big, talk about how Trump has not helped in those departments and how Biden's tax plan is actually more favorable for them.

They don't care about our causes. We have to convince them on grounds that matter to them.

Alternative to Court Packing,2,j0shwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j0shwh/alternative_to_court_packing/,4,1601247578,"1. Eliminate a set number of Justices.\*
2. Have a president nominate a new justice in the first and third year of their term.
3. Establish implied consent from the Senate after six months.
4. Set a term limit of twenty years from when this law is established.
5. Set some minimum qualification requirements for Judges and Justices; Such as rated qualified by the American Bar Association.

It would eliminate the uncertainty of how many justices get nominated by a single president. It would make the court less 'swingy' and more steady. This is a less partisan method of improving the court in the long term. It does not set a precedent of just increasing the number of justices every presidency and does not further entrench the court as a partisan institution.

So what do you guys think?

I'm a Pennsylvania registered voter but moving out of state next week. It's a temporary move so I'm still a PA resident and not the state I'm moving to (NY). I'll be there past the election 

I want to make sure I vote for Biden!

I'm already signed up for VBM from the primary. I will be here when early in person voting starts on 9/29, but leaving next day. So VBM ballots are supposed to start going out on 9/29, I will obviously not be here when it gets delivered

How can I still cast this vote?

I know early in person starts on 9/29. But isn't that for voters who haven't requested VBM only? I thought my mail ballot would have just been mailed out by 9/29, so I can't use in person early. I'm not sure, if anyone knows?

Or can I change the address where my VBM is sent? If they can send to my temporary address in NY that's perfect, but I wasn't sure. Anyone know?

Or perhaps request an excuse absentee? But again but sure if my current VBM ballot being sent prevents that.

Thanks if anyone is able to help",9/25/2020 14:09

I'm going by the rule of thumb that it's more effective to give directly to the candidates themselves than say, the DNC for them to use however. I tried to generically search for advise that might give a little bit more of bird's eye view over all the races, but came up short. So if you had say, $100, (I intend to give more, ) how would you spread it strategically over the tighest or most vital races? Of course every race is important, but maybe you have insights or resources into who actually needs the money more right now?

I've used Actblue for Biden a few times, and given a little to Amy McGrath, but recently heard that she may not be able to overtake McConnell, and the money could be better used elsewhere? I also heard that Harrison running against Lindsey actually has plenty of money, and the polls are still tight AF. So I'm just skeptical.

Setup a stand on campus to get people to register?,7,izdzpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/izdzpg/setup_a_stand_on_campus_to_get_people_to_register/,5,1601041454,"Hi everyone!
So I just had a sudden idea and wanted to see if anyone has any suggestions or experience with something like this.

I’m currently enrolled in a community college in rural Kansas. Campus is pretty dead but ppl still are still on campus for class, so I had this idea of setting up a table and setting up a couple laptops that people can stop by to quickly register to vote (our deadline to register is October 13). Hold up a couple signs to call people over and let them know what we’re there for and yeah. 


The thing is that I’m not very involved with my campus or any organizations. I’m assuming I would have to ask some official from the school to be able to do this. I’m not a very social person, in fact I’m pretty shy but I feel very strongly in sticking it to Trump supporters here in this town and getting people to register. Especially since I know that if a lot of us younger people get together we might bare substantial weight in this election.

Any opinions, suggestions? Is this even reasonable or should i leave it alone and let someone else better versed take care of it? How would my school take it if I asked them? 

I was thinking this doesn’t have to be a big deal, but maybe I’m wrong and there’s a lot more to it? After all, I don’t really see any political groups in my town trying to get people to register or anything so maybe there’s a reason for that.",9/25/2020 9:44

What are your opinions on Puerto Rico becoming a state?,1,izaubk,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/izaubk/what_are_your_opinions_on_puerto_rico_becoming_a/,1,1601028216,"Hey all. So I’m a Hispanic-American living in Puerto Rico. As of now I am grimly witnessing what was the slow descent of what was left of American Democracy turn into a full blown high-speed train headed to fascism and I can do absolutely diddly squat about it because I don’t have a say when it comes to the presidential election. I can vote for exactly zero senators, and can only vote for a single-non-voting representative in the House (she can only vote in assigned committees). On the other hand, the outcome of the whole election will directly impact what happens over here, negatively or positively. We are 3.1 million Americans in a state of limbo where we are not our own country and therefore cannot trade with other countries, but we also can’t participate in any meaningful way in the laws that Congress approves over us or over the nation as a whole. 


I wanted to ask y’all directly. What are your thoughts on admitting Puerto Rico as a state? 

Before you answer here are some facts:

1. Puerto Rico is about the size of Iowa. It would have 6 electoral votes. 

2. I can see Puerto Rico as a lean D state, having 1-2 Dem Senators and 2-3 Dem representatives, depending on the election year. 

3. Essentially, we lean Democrat, but we could easily go Republican if it’s a wave year and with the right messaging. Similarly to a smaller Michigan or Pennsylvania.",9/25/2020 6:03

DEEP STATE?,1,iz49ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iz49ly/deep_state/,1,1601005448,"So, I have a question. If Democrats are all part of a ""deep state"" conspiracy, is it the lamest of all overthrows of any government anywhere? Everything the Democrats have done since trump has been in office has been a colossal failure. How can you take over a government with all the following rules and working within the boundaries of the law. 
I mean if you are going to overthrow a government you would need a charismatic leader that could make people believe whatever he wants, you would want to devide the nation and make your followers feel as if there very life is at stake and the other half of the nation wants to subjugate every aspect of there lives. You want to get leaders of your party to fall lock step in behind you. Skirt the law, convince your followers that you are exactly like they are even though it should be obvious that he is nothing like you. Start saying that everything the other party does is in antithesis of what you belive and you need to defend it to save the world. Start saying that if the other party wins it can only be because they cheated and lied. Then you, yourself lie, lie, lie never admit fault or weakness. If some disagrees with you or your agenda start blowing the dog whistles and destroy them. Push, push,push don't stop never pass up an opportunity to denigrate and sow seeds of doubt and discontent. Change the rules to meet your needs. Make small changes that no one would suspect anything until all the rules have been change to benefit you. And finally get help from an enemy state. 
Democrats haven't done any of these things, so I guess we need to get on the ball before the Republicans do....this.....shit!",9/24/2020 23:44

So I’ve been following the press titles regarding the Supreme Court judges and Trump. I didn’t really understand it really. Tried to read some articles but none of them is “non-US-citizen- friendly”. Can someone explains what happened exactly, and how is that affecting the elections? The reason why I’m asking is that I’m in the final episodes of House of Cards S05 (not gonna see S06) and there are lots of similarities between the psychopaths that are Trump and Francis underwood. 

Their manipulative, anti-social (in the psychological context) personality made it hard for me to ignore the fact the House of Cards is actually predicting what’s gonna happen in the near future.

I watched American citizens and reporters get beaten and gassed illegally. I watched it be done by local police, military, and federal forces. I got pissed off. I started protesting for the first time. Accidentally started a veteran organization. 3 months later we're growing and the need is bigger than ever. My eyes have been opened and I can't unsee the travesty occurring in our country right now. Now we need your help. [Volunteer here.](https://www.continuetoserve.vet/get-involved) [Our website here.](https://www.continuetoserve.vet)

&#x200B;

On June 1st, I watched something I had never personally witnessed. I watched people, citizens, reporters, journalists, photographers, peacefully protesting or doing their jobs reporting the news, be beaten, gassed, and shot with rubber bullets. I had blackhawks hovering over my house and a city I have come to love and call home was flooded with thousands of federal officers and military personnel. It was a small taste of what martial law would be like. And as a combat veteran, as someone who has lost people overseas in what I now believe were useless and unnecessary wars, I did not sign up, deploy, and lose friends, my mental health, my own family upon my return, so that I could watch a President utterly destroy the very fabric our nation was founded on.

On June 2nd, myself and a fellow veteran I deployed with went to BLM Plaza to stand in solidarity with the BLM movement and for the rights of all Americans to protest and exercise their 1A right to free speech. We stood because we believed that the military should never be used on US soil to silence a free people with rights. This is not the America I grew up believing in. So we stood. 

Having never organized before, having never gone to a protest, I had no idea what to do or what to expect. We've now been out there for 3 months. Standing with, supporting local BLM grassroots orgs, and now we are on the brink of establishing our own 501c3 to continue our mission. We are Continue To Serve, a veteran-based nonprofit, focused on social justice issues and community service. We stand for the rights of all citizens and intend to remember our oath to support and defend the Constitution and the citizens it represents. 

I'm not asking for donations. I am asking for something more valuable, we need your time, your energy, your expertise. Veterans, please join us in standing up for what is right and calling out what is wrong. We are a direct action organization, but in time, we are planning on establishing training and education platforms, community service support systems, and we will expand into more than just the BLM Movement and the Vote. There are many issues that need our attention and veterans can no longer sit idle and stay quiet. We must stand. Please join us. No matter where in the country you are, we can use your help.

**WHO TO NOT DONATE TO**

Amy McGrath of Kentucky 
I loath Mitch McConnell, but if polls are any indication, McGrath can not win, it is not worth it to spend money on this race, it's sad, but the next best thing to replacing McConnell is making him lose control of the senate 

Doug Jones of Alabama 
It pains me to say this, but Jones is losing, there's not anything that can be done about it. Alabama is red as hell and it's just a waste of money. I love Jones and wouldn't trade his last three years representing Alabama for anything, but it was always borrowed time. (I'm hoping he gets picked for Attorney General)

John Hickenlooper of Colorado 
Full stop, Gardner is done, Hickenlooper will win in Colorado no matter what, which is good because it's more money to other senate races

Mark Kelly of Arizona 
Mark Kell is up against McSally, BY DOUBLE DIGITS. Kelly has all the money he needs, this seat is another safe Dem pickup 

**WHO TO SEND MONEY TOO**

Alaska may be red but it's also very independent and that's who Gross is, and independent with the backing of the democratic party. Polls shows a race with many undecideds but ultimately this is a long shot. If you want to, give the good Doctor some moeny

Dr. Barbara Bollier of Kansas https://bollierforkansas.com
Another doctor and another long shot. While Kobach is unfortunately not her opponent, polls still show a close race. I wish we had more but until then she's not a bad investment 

Mike Espy of Mississippi https://espyforsenate.com
Another long shot but a possible pickup if we're lucky. He came close in the special election in 2018 so here's to hoping he wins.

MJ Hegar of Texas https://mjfortexas.com
Texas is trending blue, and while Cornyn is not as disliked as Cruz, he is also not as well known. Polls aren't the best but there's a possibility here. Fingers crossed 

That's it for now. All other seats are safe for both democrats and republicans. Please give what you can and even volunteer

The past two rep presidents didn’t win the popular vote. George bush won when Florida (run by his brother Jeb) said they miscounted the votes and it was too close to call. Then W (from an oil family) sent America to war with a country based on the lie that they had weapons of mass destrucion. Iraq never did.  They had oil which we annexed and they had death for thousands of Americans. Bush lied. Got what he wanted and thousands died. 

Donald also didn’t win the popular vote. He won when Russia interfered in the election and got him the win. This, in addition to years of gerrymandering districts to benefit republican outcomes and making it virtually impossible for low income citizens to vote in republican urban areas got him the win. Now he has assigned one of his largest financial donors to run the post office to manage mail in ballots. For the epidemic, Donald  admitted he lied to the American people that it was not so bad. He lied and hundreds of Thousands more Americans died. 

The republican head of the senate blocked the assignment of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee for a whole year saying it was too close to an election to vote. And now with less than two months to an election he is trying to force one in. Cheating. They make third grader excuses and say everyone does it and keep doing it. They ignore congressional subpoenas because they know they would be convicted. They suppress and attack scientific facts because they know their extremist beliefs are wrong. Cheating. 
The Republican Party can not win anything on a fair playing field so they cheat. Consistently. Year after year so they can get what they want at the expense of the rest of the country.

Hope in the midst of darkness,9,ixd4f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ixd4f5/hope_in_the_midst_of_darkness/,4,1600764004,"Fellow Democrats,

Be brave!

We are facing the greatest challenge since World War II, we stand in the midst of darkness. The pandemic is taking countless lives due to the greatest dereliction of duty by a President in the history of America and those who follow him. The economic consequences will be felt for years to come as will the grief for every American lost. There will be a need to care for those who will have suffered permanent damage to their lungs and hearts. Not to mention the psychological trauma this period will have caused on thousands of Americans. Children all across America will need all the support we can give them to get them back on track in school, young adults will need support to get their careers back on track. All this as we must, absolutely must, tackle the crisis of global warming head on.

Be full of Hope!

I am full of hope, even as we stand in the midst of darkness, while the Republicans are clawing their hooks into the Supreme Court, and the pandemic rages on, I am full of hope. 

I am hopefull because people all across America have had it. They've had it with draconian Republican policies that no longer are tolerable. The republican party has been leaning on anti abortion, anti health care, anti financial aid, anti LGBTG  rights, anti climate and anti truth for too long and people have had it. People have had it with republican cronyism and self dealing. People have had it with the President and the Senate who serve themselves and wall street over the stakeholders of this nation.

Work arduously!

We are ahead in crucial senate races, in particular in Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado. When we win those races we take the senate. Recent polling shows we are competitive in Alaska, Montana, Kansas, Texas, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina. Let's us get right on it because America deserves better, America wants better.

This is the election were we beat back the darkness, this is the election were we retake the senate, the presidency and keep the house and get this nation back on track. 

Sleep sound at night knowing that there is hope in the midst of darkness and wake to work for the change America needs.",9/22/2020 4:40
Democrat Agenda for first 100 days,12,ixcyt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ixcyt1/democrat_agenda_for_first_100_days/,10,1600763420,"There is no doubt that the Republicans have been re-writing rules to allow them to maintain their minority rule (evidence in stacking federal judges after refusing hearings with Obama, stealing the Garland seat and then reversing with RBG). Here are my thoughts on what the democrat administration needs to do to restore democracy. This assumes Biden wins and we take back at least 50 seats in the Senate.

1. Get rid of the filibuster. Republicans aren't interested in norms or rules and the dems should stop playing by the old rules. In order to restore order to the republic with reform, this rule needs to go.
2. Term limits on Supreme Court judges. I know a lot of folks talk about packing the court, but the challenge is the death spiral this creates. When republicans get power back they'd just do the same, so we'd go from 9 to 11 to 13 and so on. Term limits could accomplish the same goal. If set at 16 years, effective immediately, it would boot Thomas, Robert and Altito- along with Breyer. This would give the dems a 5-4 advantage in the first term. 
3. Statehood for DC and consider splitting California into two states. Red states have way too much power overall, relative to population. The only way to level this playing field is to add to the field. By adding 2 - 4 safe democratic seats, the senate will be more reflective of the US population.
4. Get rid of the electoral college. Small population center states votes count more than dense states. The electoral college is the only reason republicans have won in the recent past. Every vote should be equal in the presidential election.
5. New voter rights laws, including federal rules restricting Gerrymandering. Clearly the dems need to restore voter rights that the Supreme Court knocked down. But, in addition, we have to stop the blatant gerrymandering. I'm not sure the answer, but the crazy shapes to ensure a democrat or republican victory have to go. Gerrymandering allows for more 'safe' districts where a party can run an extreme candidate and win. This encourages more and more extreme candidates that aren't beholden to the people because they can't be voted out. Get rid of this and we can reduce extreme politics (and maybe, just maybe the parties will start working together occasionally).
6. New laws on the media to make them accountable for their reporting. Opinion shows rule the cable news network and Fox has no journalist integrity. Hannity will report on conspiracy theories like they are fact and then does not retract when they are proven false. There has to be penalties for spreading false information without equal time retracting the information (on the same show). This should extent to FB, BTW.

&#x200B;

Once you have all of this done, the democrats need to move fast on health care, tax reform and corruption laws. But without the above done, we'll be hanging from fingertips every 2-4 years.  Government needs to work for the people, not the few, special interests and the rich. Biden and team will need to have some courage to pass all of these suggestions and, if they do, the country could become sane again.",9/22/2020 4:30

The Mississippi Senate might just be competitive,8,ix54un,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ix54un/the_mississippi_senate_might_just_be_competitive/,0,1600738649,"The Mississippi Senate might just be competitive according to this latest poll. The Republican Incumbent (Cindy Hyde-Smith) is up by only 1 point. Looking at the polling, there is an obvious trend which can be seen. Mike Espy is gaining ground. Around May, the margin was 28 points, but since then, all polls indicate that the race is tightening up and is now within reach.

I know the likelihood of Mike Espy winning in Mississippi are low, even with the polls and all. But this just shows how a Blue wave is coming to drown Moscow Mitch and his henchmen.

Are Trump campaign fundraising emails and texts illegal?,0,ix0tbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ix0tbf/are_trump_campaign_fundraising_emails_and_texts/,4,1600725118,"**TL:DR**

My understanding is that fundraising practices for political campaigns are pretty heavily regulated. So my question is: is the Trump campaign using illegal practices, and if so, why is no one taking it to court?

**Details**

I thought it would be interesting to sign up for Trump emails and texts. Interesting it was, but also kinda scary. And more specifically, full of lies and deception. Beyond being angry about this (somehow it really boiled my blood that he's taking advantage of his own supporters), it really seems like it should be illegal to lie in your campaign fundraising. I'm especially interested in verifying these ""700% match"" claims. Here are a few specific example snippets (with real name redacted):

Texts:

“2016, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait to the next election.”

2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): “I don’t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.”

2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): “The very balance of our nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.”

2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice.” 

2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): “The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.”

2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): “In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.” 

2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.”

2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.”

2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): “I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.”

2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): “I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.””",9/21/2020 13:43

"Could a Democratic House and Senate (with some help) impeach and convict Trump between Jan 3 and Jan 20, 2021?",0,iwx6eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iwx6eq/could_a_democratic_house_and_senate_with_some/,8,1600709523,"I don't think this is a likely scenario. But is it possible? Nothing about the next few months is going to be typical, all kinds of shenanigans may happen. Many Democrats in power appear to have realized that restricting their strategies to any honored conventions other than the actual law and Constitution puts them at disadvantage to aggressive Republican tactics.

Winners of the November 2020 election will be sworn in on these dates:

New senators are sworn in Jan 3, 2021.

Source: [Wikipedia - 2020 US Senate elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_Senate_elections)

New representatives sessions also start Jan 3.

Source: [Wikipedia - US House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives)

BUT, any new president would not be inaugurated, until January 20, 2021.

Source: [Wikipedia - US Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election)

ERGO: From January 3, 2021 until January 20, 2021, there would be a window of time where a Democratic majority in the House and Senate could both impeach President Trump - even if Trump was a lame duck president.

Granted a Senate conviction even with a Democratic majority would be difficult, given the need for 2/3 votes to convict. But as the majority, Democrats would have new power to highlight Trump's impeached behavior and pressure or persuade Republican's to help.

Last note: If Trump were convicted in January by the Senate, but had won the election, his ability to take up office on January 20, 2021 would still depend on a separate vote by the Senate on whether to prevent him from ever being able to hold office again. That would seem certain after a conviction given a Democratic majority and this quote from the source below:

Some issues I expect with this are:

* finding enough liberals willing and able to move from a blue state to Wyoming
* the cost involved in subsidizing the massive migration

There's only going to be 3 debates I guess. The first is next Tuesday on Sept. 29th. VP debate is October 7th. Second is October 15th. Final is October 22nd.

Chris Wallace moderates the first. I don't think Trump is preparing for the debate in any way based on what I've read. Biden stated he wants to be a fact checker on the debate stage. 90 minutes long.

The VP debate is moderated by Susan Page, Washington bureau chief USA Today. 90 minutes long.

The 2nd debate is moderated by Steve Scully, political editor of CSPAN. 90 minutes long. It's a town hall format in Miami. 

The 3rd debate is moderated by Kristen Welker, NBC News White House correspondent and co-anchor of Today Weekend. 90 minutes long.",9/20/2020 23:58

This Is What Republicans Previously Said About Appointing SCOTUS Justices During An Election Year,13,iwd7a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iwd7a1/this_is_what_republicans_previously_said_about/,7,1600634712,"**Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO):** “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.” 

**Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC):** “In this election year, the  American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the  future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy  left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a  new president.” 

**Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX):**  “I believe the American people deserve to have a voice in the  selection of the next Supreme Court Justice, and the best way to ensure  that happens is to have the Senate consider a nomination made by the  next President.

Confirming a new Supreme Court Justice during a presidential election  year for a vacancy arising that same year is not common in our nation’s  history; the last time it happened was in 1932. And it has been almost  130 years since a presidential election year nominee was confirmed for a  vacancy arising the same year under divided government as we have  today.""

**Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX):** “It has been 80 years since a  Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year.  There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

**Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA):** “We will see what the people say this fall and our next president, regardless of party, will be making that nomination.” 

**Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO):** “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision."" 

**Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC):** “If an opening comes in  the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has  started, we’ll wait to the next election” 

**Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA):** “A lifetime appointment  that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the  direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get  bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a  voice.” 

**Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND):** “There is 80 years of  precedent for not nominating and confirming a new justice of the Supreme  Court in the final year of a president’s term so that people can have a  say in this very important decision.” 

**Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK):** “It makes the current  presidential election all that more important as not only are the next  four years in play, but an entire generation of Americans will be  impacted by the balance of the court and its rulings. Sens. Barack  Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid have all  made statements that the Senate does not have to confirm presidential  nominations in an election year. I will oppose this nomination as I  firmly believe we must let the people decide the Supreme Court’s  future.” 

**Sen. David Perdue (R-GA):** “The very balance of our  nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the  president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear  from the American people.” 

**Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH):** “I believe the best thing  for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who  should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court  for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the  Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a  presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president  was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential  election year.” 

**Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL):** “I don’t think we should be  moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term — I would  say that if it was a Republican president .” 

**Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC):** “Vice President Biden’s  remarks may have been voiced in 1992, but they are entirely applicable  to 2016. The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the  institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not  launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during  the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to  elect our next president.” 

**Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA):** “The next Court appointment should be made by the newly-elected president.”

If Trump loses and Republicans lose the senate, ole Moscow Mitch will still try to jam a nomination down America’s throat. Judicial nominees(all appointed positions) has been Mitchy’s game for over a decade.

Mark Kelly is currently favored by 538’s model 78/22. This election by far is a Dems best chance of unseating a Republican. Right now Dems need 4 Republicans to break rank to defeat the Republican senate. If Mark wins, Dems only need 3. It looks like Republican senators in Maine and Alaska will not vote with their party before the election or after if Biden wins. It’s likely that Dems could pick up 1 more if Biden wins.

Further, he is the wife of Rep. Gabby Gifford who was shot while in office, a combat pilot, and an astronaut. Decent resume if I do say so. Plus, he would fill the seat of late Sen. McCain who we all saw do the right thing with his vote to repeal Obamacare.

Obviously this all hinges on Biden winning, but it’s the easiest thing we can do right now while on Reddit before we can formulate a full strategy now that the election has changed. 

Finally, donate to all Dems that you believe in or that we need. This is a suggestion if you have limited funds and you want to get the best bang for your buck. 

Disclaimer: I live in WA and I do not work for nor am I affiliated with the Kelly campaign. I love political strategy and the law. I graduated with a Poli Sci degree and then went on to law school and passed the bar exam.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait to the next election.”

2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): “I don’t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.”

2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): “The very balance of our nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.”

2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice.” 

2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): “The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.”

2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): “In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.” 

2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.”

2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.”

2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): “I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.”

2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): “I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.”

Increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court to reverse GOP court packing and how to message about it,2,iw03og,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iw03og/increasing_the_number_of_seats_on_the_supreme/,0,1600575915,"Everyone needs to start recognizing and talking about the fact that the GOP has been packing the courts, including the Supreme Court, for the past 10 years.

If the Democrats win the Presidency and Senate in November there will be a big push from the base to abandon the filibuster and increase the number of seat on the Supreme Court to pack it with left wing judges. This was already talked about before RBG died, and will be absolutely necessary if Trump and McConnell fill her seat. Obama talked about dropping the filibuster during his speech at John Lewis's funeral. The idea isn't new.

What we need to start doing NOW is preparing the ground rhetorically for increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court. The media, the GOP, and politically non-engaged people will decry this at cheating, and court packing. We need to start preparing to counter this argument.

The fact is that the GOP has been court packing ever since 2012. If increasing the number of seats on a court and filling them with like minded judges is court packing, then so is preventing existing seats from being filled under the Constitutionally proscribed process because the person filling them would appoint judges you don't like until a like minded President is elected to fill those seats.

Mitch McConnell packed the Supreme Court when he prevented Obama from naming a replacement for Scalia's seat. He packed the lower courts when he spent 6 years blocking judicial appointments. The past decade of GOP control of the Senate has seen the most egregious court packing in US history. Democrats increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court and lower courts isn't court packing, it's reversing the court packing the GOP has been practicing for a decade.

Everyone should write their Democratic Senators and Senate candidates and express this view. Don't ask them to pack the Supreme Court. Ask them to increase the seats to reverse the court packing the GOP has gotten away with. Frame it like this every single time you talk about it.",9/20/2020 0:25

The AvengeHer Plan,5,ivzrxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ivzrxv/the_avengeher_plan/,0,1600574794,"(First, abolish the filibuster.)

1. The lower circuit courts of appeals have a wild disparity in number of judges in relation to population. The 11th circuit has one judge for every 2.7 million people while the 10th circuit has one judge for every 1.4 million. This should be made uniform, 1 judge for every million people in a circuit, with a circuit capped at 21 judges with a minimum of 11. Every ten years after the census the courts should be expanded to account for population growth.
2. That means that there should be approximately 332 appeals court judges not 179. This should be spread over 16 circuit courts not 12 plus the Federal and DC Circuit courts which should be brought up to the maximum of 21 judges. This means we need to confirm 172 new appeals court judges to bring population balance to the appeals courts.
3. The Supreme Court use to have a judge to account for each circuit court. Today each Supreme Court Justices is assigned a circuit court to cover with some having to cover multiple courts. This is an unreasonable burden to place on the justices so the court should be expanded so there is one Supreme Court justice for every circuit court.
4. That means there should be 18 Supreme Court Justices and we'll need to confirm an additional 9 justices to meet the requirements of the new law. Every ten years after the census a Supreme Court member will be added to account for any growth in the circuit courts.

We will be establishing some much needed equal representation to the circuit courts and returning the Supreme Court to its traditional role of representing the size of the circuit courts. It's a reasonable plan based on tradition and equality of representation. Also Fuck Mitch McConnell.",9/20/2020 0:06

I’m a 22 year old from Columbus Ohio, I’ve been a democrat my entire life (basically since I understood basic civics education and economics, my family also leans left), I fall between moderate and progressive. With Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s untimely and disappointing passing and upcoming election, I was wondering if we can make an election fund in order to support the democrats who are running for congress, senate, local elections and etc. In particular, this fund can help support those who are in critical/close-call races. Another republican pick to the supreme court maybe disastrous to this country in the long term, there needs to be a balance in the highest court of the land, and hopefully some republicans follow their set principles from 2016 and block a new nominee appointment before the 2021 inauguration. Now more than ever, we need leaders who have a progressive mindset and want to create honest change and can push our country to further heights, this fund should allow that to take place.

Please let me know if this is a good idea, if you guys are interested, and if the moderators are also interested.

Is there anyway we can do this, or does this already exist? I was hoping maybe the Moderators can take a look and maybe create some sort of fund for us to donate to!

#VOTE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE
---
####Mail-In Voting aka Absentee Voting

As of today, MN, VA, SD and WY join PA in beginning early voting to defeat the most dangerous President in history. Make no mistake, this is the most important election of our lives. Nearly all states have expanded mail-in voting eligibility to all citizens, with most states automatically mailing ballots or ballot applications to everyone. If you have not received one, [request your absentee ballot now.](https://www.vote.org/) Nearly all states have waved any requirements for witness/notary for mail-in ballots this election, **however MO has not!** If you live in MO, make a plan now on how to safely vote. (If you know of any other states that have restrictions on voting, please share details in the comments.)

####In-Person Voting

Early voting has begun! Most states are strongly discouraging in-person voting this election due to the pandemic. Check your local state's websites to see if in-person early voting is still available, as many states have switched to mail-in ballot drop-off only. If you choose to vote in-person, first check your voter registration, polling place and any other voting requirements in your state such as an ID. [Currently, most states can request and some require a form of ID to vote in-person.](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx)

####Register to Vote

Voter registration is still open for all 50 states. The first states begin closing voter registration starting Oct 4th, so don't wait! If you haven't yet, now is the time to register, and get your friends and family registered too: https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/

####Election Protection

If you experience harassment, intimidation, or anyone trying to prevent you from voting, report it to Election Protection Hotline (866-687-8683) immediately. No matter what, under federal law you always have the right to cast a provisional ballot, so there is no reason not to try and vote. Make sure you're at the right polling location: in 27 states, if you cast a provisional ballot at the wrong polling location, your vote will not be counted.

First, I'd like to see *much* more of Biden giving performances like last night town hall. He needs to be everywhere. So does Harris. Trump clearly has an unfair advantage of consistent exposure. We need to do everything we can to help match that.

What can you do?

* DONATE to Biden/Harris or your local fav. ANY amount is welcome.
* PUT UP THE SIGN in your yard and the sticker on your car.
* CORRECT MISINFORMATION / false statements in conversations (but check your emotions).
* Get other Dems to register and VOTE.
* Don't be afraid to SPEAK THE TRUTH on social media (and make sure it is the truth).
* VOLUNTEER any time you can to the candidate of your choice.

The Republican Party - or what's left of it - is a loud and misguided organism. It's time we made the noise of truth to match. MAKE SOME NOISE!",9/18/2020 16:10

I was just push-polled from Pennsylvania,6,iu2dd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iu2dd8/i_was_just_pushpolled_from_pennsylvania/,4,1600312466,"I was just push-polled from Pennsylvania.  Even though I live in Seattle I still have the same Pittsburgh cell number I've owned for 20 years.  Some highlights of the call:

* Cold call from a Pittsburgh Area code (412)
* Caller spoke perfect English but had an Indian accent. He was extremely polite and spoke loudly and slowly
* Asked for me by firstname, middlename, lastname  Only about 4 people on Earth know my middle name.  I wonder if this gives insight into how they got my info. 

I told him that I was no longer available at this number but that I love surveys and would gladly take one. 

* He asked me some basic questions regarding if I am registered and if I plan to vote in 2020
* Asked if I was ""locked in"" to my choice or if I could have my mind changed
* Asked how locked in I felt I was

(He very specifically used the word ""party"" for everyone but Trump)

* Asked who I was thinking of voting for.  List of candidates went Dario Hunter, Green Party; Joe Biden, Democratic Party; Donald J Trump, Republican; Jo Jorgensen, Libertarian party

* Favorability of Biden
* Favorability of Trump
* Favorability of Pelosi
* Policy details on a favorability scale. A typical kind of question would be

> Very favorable, Somewhat favorable, Neutral, Somewhat unfavorable, very unfavorable: Instituting a tax plan that would raise taxes on every American while damaging the economy and harming small business

* Questions were primarily economic focused
* Opinion on the favorability scale of ""Hunter Biden and the Biden family using lobbying money and Russian bribes to enrich themselves at the expense of the American people.""

* Opinion on favorability scale of Donald Trumps performance as president
* Opinion on direction of the country
* Opinion on direction of the economy
* Opinion on Trumps economy performance
* Opinion on Trumps security performance
* Opinion on Trumps wildfire performance
* Opinion on Trumps Coronavirus performance
* Which candidate would do better on Defense, which on economy, which on Coronavirus, which on environment, which on corruption

(I thought this next one was strange)

* If you had to choose between two candidates, A and B, where A was a nice guy who means well but was an ineffective lifetime politician, leader of a corrupt family and in bed with a liberal agenda and B was not the nicest person but always had the best interests of the American people at heart and could project strength while keeping the economy strong, which would you pick?

* Favorability of different tax policy propositions. The propositions basically involved ""A a tax plan that would [do very bad sounding things]"" (for stuff that was obviously Biden or ""This proposal that would [do very nice sounding things] "" (for stuff that was obviously Trump)

* Would you vote for a candidate who was going to attack social security and healthcare benefits, and enact policies that would put many Americans over 75 on the street, including those making less than $30K a year

* Once again, who are you planning to vote for in November.
* How certain are you about that vote
* Demographic data - since I told him I wasn't me he took my full name, age bracket, income bracket, urban/suburban/rural, ethnicity, marital status
* Who did you vote for in 2016

TBH I'm not sure how anyone falls for these.

Edit: I have been getting hammered with solicitations from both parties.  Democratic stuff is usually a text message asking me to vote. They usually come in at supremely annoying times about 4-5am for me.  Republican stuff is through the phone mainly but rarely through text.  Phone stuff are polls.  I get polled about 2x weekly now.  I get a text usually during primetime for sports. The texts are almost always guilt trippy. 

I was registered dem from 2004-2016, switched to independent after 2016 primary.  If anyone on the Biden campaign is interested reads this sub, I get a lot of these and I could record them for you.

Edit 2: I almost wonder if this was a low key GOTV call for wavering 2016 Trump voters. I'm shocked they mentioned Hunter Biden when the Trump clan is corrupt to its nepotistic core. I was also surprised they didn't bring out the Supreme Court arguments.

Im sharing this here because I think the topic is very interesting and would like to hear from others who gets these and learn more about push-polling in general.",9/16/2020 23:14

===========  
The term originates in the systematic psychological manipulation of a victim by her husband in Patrick Hamilton’s 1938 stage play Gas Light, and the film adaptations released in 1940 and 1944. In the story, the husband attempts to convince his wife and others that she is insane by manipulating small elements of their environment and insisting that she is mistaken, remembering things incorrectly, or delusional when she points out these changes. The play's title alludes to how the abusive husband slowly dims the gas lights in their home, while pretending nothing has changed, in an effort to make his wife doubt her own perceptions. The wife repeatedly asks her husband to confirm her perceptions about the dimming lights, but in defiance of reality, he keeps insisting that the lights are the same and instead it is she who is going insane.  


We are living in a perpetual state of gaslighting. The reality that we are being told by the media is at complete odds with what we are seeing with our own two eyes. And when we question the false reality that we are being presented, or we claim that what we see is that actual reality, we are vilified as racist or bigots or just plain crazy. You’re not racist. You’re not crazy. You’re being gaslighted.  


New York State has twice as many deaths from Covid-19 than any other state, and New York has accounted for one fifth of all Covid-19 deaths, but we are told that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has handled the pandemic better than any other governor. But if we support policies of Governors whose states had only a fraction of the infections and deaths as New York, we’re called anti-science and want people to die. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


We see mobs of people looting stores, smashing windows, setting cars on fire and burning down buildings, but we are told that these demonstrations are peaceful protests. And when we call this destruction of our cities, riots, we are called racists. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


We see the major problem destroying many inner-cities is crime; murder, gang violence, drug dealing, drive-by shootings, armed robbery, but we are told that it is not crime, but the police that are the problem in the inner-cities. We are told we must defund the police and remove law enforcement from crime-riddled cities to make them safer. But if we advocate for more policing in cities overrun by crime, we are accused of being white supremacists and racists. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


The United States of America accepts more immigrants than any other country in the world. The vast majority of the immigrants are “people of color”, and these immigrants are enjoying freedom and economic opportunity not available to them in their country of origin, but we are told that the United States is the most racist and oppressive country on the planet, and if we disagree, we are called racist and xenophobic. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Capitalist countries are the most prosperous countries in the world The standard of living is the highest in capitalist countries. We see more poor people move up the economic ladder to the middle and even the wealthy class through their effort and ability in capitalist countries than any other economic system in the world, but we are told capitalism is an oppressive system designed to keep people down. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Communist countries killed over 100 million people in the 20th century. Communist countries strip their citizens of basic human rights, dictate every aspect of their lives, treat their citizens like slaves, and drive their economies into the ground, but we are told that Communism is the fairest, most equitable, freest and most prosperous economic system in the world. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


The most egregious example of gaslighting is the concept of “white fragility”. You spend your life trying to be a good person, trying to treat people fairly and with respect. You disavow racism and bigotry in all its forms. You judge people solely on the content of their character and not by the color of their skin. You don’t discriminate based on race or ethnicity. But you are told you are a racist, not because of something you did or said, but solely because of the color of your skin. You know instinctively that charging someone with racism because of their skin color is itself racist. You know that you are not racist, so you defend yourself and your character, but you are told that your defense of yourself is proof of your racism. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Gaslighting has become one of the most pervasive and destructive tactics in American politics. It is the exact opposite of what our political system was meant to be. It deals in lies and psychological coercion, and not the truth and intellectual discourse. If you ever ask yourself if you’re crazy, you are not. Crazy people aren’t sane enough to ask themselves if they’re crazy. So, trust yourself, believe what’s in your heart. Trust your eyes over what you are told. Never listen to the people who tell you that you are crazy, because you are not, you’re being gaslighted.  


Sophocles said: ""What people believe prevails over the truth.""  


And that's what the media are trying to exploit.

What a Democratic House Leadership could look like in 2021,1,irmpe5,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/irmpe5/what_a_democratic_house_leadership_could_look/,2,1599980334,"This is an interesting situation. Speaker Pelosi has held her speakership for 3 terms now. To become the 52nd speaker to pledged to limit herself. So she might not become speaker, but if she wants it, she’ll probably get it. But with Assistant Speaker Lujan most likely becoming Senator for New Mexico, and the growing calls for a change in Democratic House Leadership.

(Sidebar: The current top 3 for the democrats in the house are all over 80, but they all won’t leave at the same time. So I believe from the 117th Congress there’ll be changes)

Let’s all be honest here, the democrats will maintain control of the house. Whether they win the Senate or the Presidency is to be determined. Nonetheless, the top 5 will change. Whether Biden wins or not (I believe he will), Rep. Richmond, currently assistant to the Majority Whip, will become the majority whip, even more so if Biden wins as his influence will exponentially rise in Washington. Rep. Jeffries will move from Caucus Chair and Rep. Clark (currently Vice-Chair) will most likely take over. Rep. Jeffries might move to Majority Leader, with Rep. Hoyer (currently Majority Leader) to Speaker. Rep. Bustos (currently DCCC Chair), might move to Assistant Speaker or they’ll have a more progressive here.

But I suspect 117th House Democratic Leadership will look like:

Speaker of the House - Rep. Steyn Hoyer

Majority Leader - Rep. Hakeem Jeffries

Majority Whip - Rep. Cedric Richmond

Assistant Speaker - Rep. Cheri Bustos

Caucus Chair - Rep. Katherine Clark


W.r.t. Rep. Schiff, he’ll remain HPSCI Chair or become DNI if Biden wins. There’s also talk he might run for Senate as Sen. Feinstein would most likely not run for re-election. But that’s going to be a crowded field, from Gov. Newsome to CA Sec of State Padilla to CA AG Beccera, maybe even the Lt. Gov. Kounalakis. As I do think, under the presumption of Biden/Harris winning, Rep. Bass would take Harris’ seat or at least a minority female will be replacing her.

The other progressives in the Democratic Caucus are young and need some years in the House before they move into leadership. I give them 2/3 terms before their moves into House Leadership.

With Rep. Pelosi and Rep. Clyburn out, I still believe they’ll be advising the new house leaders in their roles to help them along the way until they retire from the house, which would be within the next 4 years.",9/13/2020 2:58

Pretty big vent in Boston on 9/19 at 12pm! I'm helping organize w/ Humanity Forward. The event is a rally in support of universal basic income and our communities. Word on the street is that appearances by Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Ayanna Pressley as key speakers are TBD, but in the works.

Dozens of community members, local workers, candidates for office, local officials, state legislators, and more will rally together with hundreds of Massachusettsans to declare loud and proud that we deserve better; that our dignity, our freedom, our livelihood, our security isn't a luxury, it's a right -- it's a cornerstone of the American Dream.

Some orgs that are our affiliates: Basic Income Boston, Massachusetts High School Democrats, MA Democrats, HeadCount, MassAlliance, OurRevoulution Boston, Boston Climate Strike, GreenEra MA, New Economic Coalition, and many more. And dozens of other organizations are set to come out in support of the rally very soon (including numerous unions, workers groups, family advocates, and more)!

Join us, and stand with our fellow Americans to fight for economic and social justice for the communities in Massachusetts and across the nation.

If you can't attend, we hope you can help spread the word online and to your friends.

"Today on Senator McCain's funeral,only one living president is not invited : Donald Trump. Till this day he didn't apologize to McCain's family or the POWs for trashing all those members in uniform who were captured and tortured by our enemies.",983,9c2tsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9c2tsl/today_on_senator_mccains_funeralonly_one_living/,27,1535835251,"In an Op-Ed in today's NYT ""Straining to Keep Faith with America"" Bret Stephens has trashed Trump in no uncertain terms by adding this in his piece ""John McCain knew that we are better than Trump.""

To that I like to add my own thoughts saying that maybe, I emphasize the word ""maybe"" again to say that maybe a healthy Senator McCain could put a stop to a marauding president called Trump. 

But with the Republican Senator John McCain's death, there is nothing that can stop Trump from destroying each and every American values that this country developed over two centuries plus more.

Even a Republican president Ronald Reagan's description of America was much different from Trump's vision.

By quoting a phrase from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Reagan declared that our country is like ""a shining city on a hill"".

But since Trump took over the presidency, every Americans are ""straining to keep Faith with America"", the country they love dearly unlike Trump and his followers who only think of what they can get. 

Even Democratic president John Kennedy's words on his inauguration on January 20th, 1961, ""Ask not what your country can do for you_ask what can do for your country"", have no sway over the minds of these fake ""swamp cleaners"" like Trump. 

Trump is more interested in finding how much money he can milk from his presidency than giving some of his assets to the countrymen who were really struggling everyday to keep their faith on America.

Their struggles to keep faith on our institutions are four hundred times more now than before Trump took office on Jan 20th, '17.

That is the reason why we've to feel sorry for John McCain's permanent absence from an institution, mainly the Senate where he grilled each and every Trump's appointees and his cabinet members to hit hard at Trump's illogical policies.

Trump on the other hand didn't have the decency to go to McCain before his death or to his wife and families now to apologize saying, ""I should've never said that I don't care for people like you who got captured at war. As you know I didn't go to Vietnam for my bad foot. But I really appreciate your pains and sufferings due to terrible tortures at the hands of the Vietcong guerrillas. I'm really sorry that you endured those tortures for five plus years just to keep our country safe. May God bless your soul.""

Am I really dreaming that Trump would say those kind words and apologize to John McCain or his wife Cindy or his children or to all our POWs ?  Not in a million years ! No way .",9/1/2018 16:54

After finding out that I was actually still registered to vote in NC - where my absentee voter ballot was sent to- I went online today to attempt to register in my current state of SC so that I can actually vote.  Given my license number and social security number, the website located my DMV resident address in SC and it was correct. It then asks previous registration state (NC), and previous registration county (Mecklenburg). The next prompt is where it has lost me. 

The website lists in clear, capital red letters “DO NOT ENTER YOUR RESIDENCE ADDRESS AS YOUR MAILING ADDRESS”. What on earth would I list, if not my resident address? I don’t think I can use my parents home as mailing address, because they are in NC. I can’t move on to the next step until I list this “mailing address” that is NOT my resident address. 

Please forgive my ignorance, but I want to vote! Can anyone help me figure out how to proceed with this? I’ll go in person (masked, obviously)  if I need to to vote, but I know I have to be registered first!

Jesus Christ - the debate was miserable. Trump did nothing but bully somebody trying to stay on topic. To add to that, he decided to say the election can't be trusted and that - basically - the Proud Boys should ""guard"" the polls. Fuck Trump. He deserves a major epic-scale loss on election day. And after that, prison. I want to see justice. Can you believe that in 2020, I might lose my right to healthcare, people can be jailed again for abortions, and that the right to same-sex marriage can just suddenly go back to ""not being a thing."" Memphis is my hometown. I grew up in the south. That city and that region molded a lot of who I am, for better or worse, and even I can see the terrifying tragedy of the moment. Half the country has lost it's ability to care about it's fellow citizen. Does Obamacare actually harm you? Does Roe v Wade actually harm you? If you change your perspective for five damn seconds you realize that there's nothing at stake for you. But, when it comes to ""liberals"" like me, we stand to lose the right to healthcare and are subject to exploitation and abuse by profit-driven health ""care"" companies. We stand to lose hope that people of color can actually witness empathy from a government who has killed them for centuries. We stand to go back to draconian times where women would have to hide and risk their lives so they can have one at all. We stand to lose a simple basic right that two people should be treated fairly under the rational definition of marriage. Tell me, please, what do Republicans have at stake? Zoning laws? A lop-sided, unfair court? The right… not to choose? I struggle to see love from you, Republicans, and I include my family in that. You cannot say you care and then smile as you watch what keeps me alive collapsing. You are selectively sociopathic, able to compartmentalize when love is appropriate and when it gets in the way. Churches across this country are filled with you. Seats meant for active compassion filled by cold, fear-driven hearts. I'm not a fan of guns at all, yet somehow I can talk with gun owners (because I actually believe it's more bi-partisan than the NRA wants you to know.) But, somehow the cult huffing the Trump-glue do not see me as a fellow American, and the thing I'm struggling with is that I'm beginning to feel the same way about you, those who vote Trump. This isn't a good thing and it's only going to get darker as the storm clouds of Trump descends on the festival by the river. He'll do his damndest to make sure the waters rise higher and higher, drowning all who attend, regardless of beliefs, regardless of loyalty, regardless of spirit. He is anti-love. Don't give in.",9/30/2020 22:58
About Trump mentioning Biden’s son,24,j2sa8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j2sa8n/about_trump_mentioning_bidens_son/,8,1601520933,"As someone who has grown up in a household full of addiction, and struggled with addiction myself, Biden showed pure empathy, understanding, and humbleness when he admitted his son used to be an addict. He didn’t have to, it was a private manner unrelated to the election, and yet he owned up to it. It sent chills down my spine and almost brought a tear to my eye when he said what he did about it. Never have I witnessed a politician be human and admit faults. 

Trump can’t even own up to his tax records, and Biden was able to swallow his pride and set the record straight.

YSK that Trump's debate tactic has a name: Gish Gallop,10,j2rmfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j2rmfr/ysk_that_trumps_debate_tactic_has_a_name_gish/,2,1601518863,"[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish\_Gallop](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop)

The **Gish Gallop** is the [fallacious](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy) [debate](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Debate) tactic of drowning your opponent in a flood of individually-weak [arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument) in order to prevent rebuttal of the whole argument collection without great effort. The Gish Gallop is a conveyor belt-fed version of the [on the spot fallacy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/On_the_spot_fallacy), as it's unreasonable for anyone to have a well-composed answer *immediately* available to every argument present in the Gallop. The Gish Gallop is named after [creationist](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Creationist) [Duane Gish](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Duane_Gish), who often abused it.

Although it takes a trivial amount of effort on the Galloper's part to make each individual point before skipping on to the next (especially if they cite from a pre-concocted list of Gallop arguments), a refutation of the same Gallop may likely take much longer and require significantly more effort (per [the basic principle](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Entropy) that it's always easier to *make a mess* than to clean it back up again).

The tedium inherent in untangling a Gish Gallop typically allows for very little ""creative license"" or vivid [rhetoric](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rhetoric) (in deliberate contrast to the exciting point-dashing central to *the Galloping*), which in turn risks boring the audience or readers, further loosening the refuter's grip on the crowd.

This is especially true in that the Galloper need only [win *a single one* out of all his component arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/One_single_proof) in order to be able to [cast doubt on the entire refutation attempt](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/FUD). For this reason, the refuter *must* achieve a 100% success ratio (with all the yawn-inducing elaboration that goes with such precision). Thus, Gish Galloping is frequently employed (with particularly devastating results) in timed debates. The same is true for any time- or character-limited debate medium, including [Twitter](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Twitter) and newspaper editorials.

Gish Gallops are almost always performed with numerous other logical fallacies baked in. The myriad component arguments constituting the Gallop may typically intersperse *a few* perfectly uncontroversial claims — the basic validity of which are intended to lend undue credence to the Gallop at large — with a devious hodgepodge of [half-truths](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lying_by_omission), outright [lies](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lie), [red herrings](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Red_herring) and [straw men](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man) — which, if not rebutted as the fallacies they are, pile up into egregious problems for the refuter.

There may also be [escape hatches](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Escape_hatch) or [""gotcha"" arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gotcha_argument) present in the Gallop, which are — like the Gish Gallop itself — specifically designed to be brief *to pose*, yet [take a long time to unravel and refute](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/One-way_hash_argument).

However, Gish Gallops aren't impossible to defeat — just tricky (not to say near-impossible for the unprepared). Upon closer inspection, many of the *allegedly stand-alone* component arguments may turn out to be [nothing but thinly-veiled repetitions or simple rephrasings of the same basic points](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/PRATT) — which only makes the list *taller*, not more correct (hence; ""proof *by verbosity*""). This essential flaw in the Gallop means that a skilled rebuttal of *one* component argument may in fact be a rebuttal to *many*.",9/30/2020 22:21

Should the Democrats pursue partitioning certain states in order to elect additional Senators?,1,j2q3xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j2q3xx/should_the_democrats_pursue_partitioning_certain/,2,1601514208,"The Democrats have structural disadvantages in the Senate, which leads to disadvantages in appointing Supreme Court Justices and other judges. In 2018, for example, Democratic Senate candidates collectively beat Republicans by a large margin, but the Republicans still gained seats in the Senate.

Democrats could work to bridge the gap by partitioning blue states. California, New York, and Massachusetts could likely each be partitioned in such a way that the states are still safe Democratic states, potentially leading to six more Democratic Senators. If DC is granted statehood as well, that could lead to eight more Democratic Senators. (I feel Puerto Rico should be offered statehood if the population agrees, but I believe it's presumptuous to assume their Senators would be Democrats.)

Partitioning efforts have been frequent in California, with the most recent proposal in 2018. New York saw proposals for partitioning Long Island as recently as 2010. Massachusetts hasn't had any serious proposals in the recent past, so that may be more of a long shot.

Here's a list of things you can do to help everyone make sure their voices are heard in the upcoming elections:

1. Make sure you're registered to vote and show people how they can easily check online. Here's one way to check: [https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote/voter-registration-status](https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote/voter-registration-status)
2. Know your state's voter laws! What identification do you need, does your state accept absentee voting without excuse, etc. Know if there's any tricky rules/mishaps that can get your ballot discarded! Do you need a security envelope? Find out!!
3. SHARE your state's voter info!!! On any platform you can, with whoever you can! Make sure your community's voice is being heard. 
4. Host zoom parties to help people fill out ballots together. You can research and answer questions together, so that less mistakes are made and many questions can be answered at once!
5. Become a poll worker! There is a shortage of poll workers right now, and you could be PAID. 

The most important part of voting in this election is being prepared to vote, so let's help people prepare instead of just saying""vote vote vote"" over and over. Too many people's voices have been lost because they've shown up to elections and found out they aren't registered or because they signed in the wrong place on their ballot. YOU can help by speeding the word and getting involved, which is something you can do from home!

Long-time Republican from a family of Republicans. Grew up in NC in a well-off family. Always voted down party lines, but mostly because I was too lazy to actually look up what the candidates stood for. In 2016, voted for Trump because I felt that he could fix the economy with his business experience (I was hit particularly hard from the great recession) and because Hillary was shady as shit (mostly because of what happened with Benghazi). I figured ""hell at least he's better than her, what's the worst he could do?""

Flash forward to some time around 2018 when I was reading about Trump's connections to Russia and his actions just started to make sense. I realized that ""this guy is going to get us all killed or at best turn all of our allies against us, and that's exactly what our enemies want. Of course Russia supports him and China is silently fighting the trade war on their terms...they want him to self-destruct us!""

So, I started considering not voting for Trump again, and voicing this to my family. My wife thinks I'm crazy. She thinks he does no wrong and the bad things that happen in our country just happen and no one could have done anything better. There is always an excuse for why things aren't Trump's fault or it's ""fake news"". I honestly can't tell if she is actually batshit crazy or I am anymore. 

Watching the debate tonight, it was so refreshing hearing Biden act like a fucking normal president would. I feel like our country is already in such a worse place than it was 4 years ago, and I live in a part of the country that is pretty Red. It's such a sinking feeling in my stomach to think of Trump being re-elected. I know I can only cast my vote once and can't control what others do. Feels bad. 

Sorry for the soap box, not sure where else to write all this that won't get downvoted into oblivion.

Edit: Forgot to mention that when I talk to my wife about voting for Biden she says ""says the guy who voted for Trump"", like can I not change my mind now? Is that not allowed? Can I not say I made a mistake and if I knew then what I know now things would be different? Feels like I'm taking crazy pills.",9/30/2020 8:31

Doesn't Joe remind you of what a president should be like on the debate stage?  Joe's on stage with Trump right now, and we have to show him our support.  We set a goal to raise $5.2M from texts like these before Wednesday, and we're relying on supporters like you to help make it happen.  Will you chip in $12 now?""

Why would you send out a text that containing lies (Joe did not perform particularly presidentially, and saying that Kamala sent the text is just silly) and then ask me for money?  Do you really expect a text like that to do anything but annoy people?  

I gave you money before because I believe that Democrats fight for the facts and fight to give the most people better lives.  I'm guessing that's true of many other Democrats.  How can your campaign more effectively embody that to both raise support and raise the money you clearly so urgently want?

By providing value.  

How?

Use the numbers that you have collected to provide your supporters with facts to counteract the lies being told on-stage.  That certainly doesn't mean sending a text every minute, but rather calling out the boldest of Trumps lies and providing us with sources that prove it.  Preferably ones that are as unbiased as possible and not just news articles or words from Biden's website.

By doing this, you demonstrate your belief in truth and provide supporters with effective resources to point others to and reduce the spread of false information.  In addition, I might start thinking ""Wow, they're really putting my money to good use!  Maybe I should donate more and help them.""

To anyone who reads this, please point out any flaws in the idea.  It is totally possible that I'm just ignorant of how campaigns and text banking works or not thinking things through fully.  

If you like the idea, let's work together to find out how to improve campaign activities so we can win this goddamn election.",9/30/2020 7:40
I stuck with who to vote for.,5,j2eiwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j2eiwi/i_stuck_with_who_to_vote_for/,12,1601465395,"I believe in capitalism, low taxes and focus on managing the budget, and I believe that we need law enforcement to stop the riots and to have someone from outside the police department to do investigations involving their officers. I 100% disagree with defunding or bringing a social worker with a official to a shots fired call. I believe the officers need to be more transparent with their rules of deadly force as what I learned from criminal justice involving deadly force gave me a completely different view of how these bad innocent situations happen. 

I also believe in lgbt rights as I’m gay. I don’t care if your homophobic that’s your life but it should not prevent me from living mines.

I believe Americans have to right to buy a weapon as gun violence is increasing we need to protect ourselves. Background check need to be a must. We need to fund officers to do their job as some police departments don’t have enough funding to protect their community to stop these wrongful gun owners.

My inspiration is Robert Kennedy as he was like me who wanted to end division as he said:

 “We can move in that direction as a country, in greater polarization - black people amongst blacks, and white amongst whites, filled with hatred toward one another. Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand and to comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand, compassion and love.... What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.”

I live in North Jersey and we are 100% vote-by-mail thanks to Murphey. I signed up to be a poll worker but I don't think I'm getting any response since the few polls that will be open are primarily just places to drop off your mail-in ballot. 

I've been trying to find some place to volunteer to help drive people to the polls in PA since it's a swing state but it's almost impossible to find an organization organizing it. The website for Drive the Vote is gone with no info, Carpool Vote is still functioning, but that's mainly to help drive one or two people along your path to vote.

The best one I can find is rideshare2vote.com but the closest state they are active in is West Virginia. Does anyone know of any local democratic party  or organization organizing rides to the polls in PA? Otherwise I think I might just take the 4-5 hour drive to West VA the night before Nov 3rd to help there.

I've also been letter writing and phone banking but I want something I can do to be directly involved on election day, and ideally somewhere I can make a difference, which is why I was looking at PA. I'm not to worried about NJ voting blue fortunately.",9/30/2020 1:24

At the time, it felt like we were fighting tooth and nail for the dignity of our country and our quality of life/rights. When the results came in in 2016,
I was an emotional wreck for a while. Obviously many of my fears came true, and my life has gone from wonderful and fulfilling to an isolated nightmare. Now it feels like we’re fighting for the same things as in 2016- except the stakes are even higher and even more lives are on the line.

So I want to ask of “older democrats”- does it ever get better? Is every presidential election such a desperate and exhausting fight to protect each other? Or is Trump an exception.

Help an Aussie to Understand,0,j1t54d,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j1t54d/help_an_aussie_to_understand/,12,1601386032,"Hey all, Aussie with a thought/questions and looking for some feedback. Before I begin I want to be clear this will be post both here and over at r/Republican assuming moderators from both sides are comfortable with the introspection.

So, whenever one of your political leaders is shown to have done something even their peers find reprehensible (Trump's Ukraine call, Hillary's private email server), the immediate reaction is a whataboutism attacking either the other leader or even just a dubious individual or group from across the aisle. This essentially confirms the disapproval of the favoured leader's actions, otherwise the actions would be plainly defensible outright, no?

This just seems so dopey yet 9/10 its the go-to response, and I know there are smart cookies on both sides. We don't do this to the same degree over here and if anything the party leader is crowned king dipstick and most open to criticism. Your candidates just seem to have ethical rap sheets that could circumnavigate the globe, with any item seeming ripe for disqualification. Both parties have had respectable leaders in the past and most people know somebody in their personal lives they respect - so this is possible. My thinking is that if dems/republicans were more critical of their leaders they might actually build an environment for worthwhile candidates to rise, which might then lead to candidates more palatable to voters across the political spectrum? If ever I had the chance to vote for a respectable candidate of any political leaning that wasn't dripping slime I'd jump at it. Seems like a cut the nose off to spite the face approach to me, or at least spite the other team.

So truly, what's going on here? At first I'd guess it's a compassionate understanding that we all make mistakes, but when it only really applies to one's team captain I'm left stumped.

*Disclaimer: Because it is sure to matter, most of our Aussie politicians from the major parties are spineless centrists so I am not heavily invested in either team. Regardless of the current candidates I don't believe my aligned values of integrity, fortitude and equality are the exclusive property of either US party.*",9/29/2020 9:27

Here's an issue that should unite liberals and the left: Trump's fascistic tactics in Portland. Why aren't we talking about this more?,5,j12duh,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j12duh/heres_an_issue_that_should_unite_liberals_and_the/,2,1601282918,"Many of you already know about this, but for those who don't. Take a look at this timeline of the protests in Portland: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Portland,_Oregon

**June**

* Mostly peaceful, few stories of mild civil unrest
* No request for federal assistance from Mayor Wheeler or Governor Brown
* No constitutional authority for Trump to intervene

**Late June**

Trump issues an executive order to protect statues. Because of course he fucking did. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_deployment_of_federal_forces_in_the_United_States#Founding_of_PACT

This gives him the constitutional excuse he needs to not only assemble a task force of federal agents, but to enter cities where the precious statues might be endangered.

**July**

After the feds get involved, it's just story after story of riots and violence.

**August**

Feds finally pull out, and it immediately gets more peaceful. Not as peaceful as June, unsurprisingly. 

The fucking priorities of this man. In the middle of a pandemic, he issues an executive order to protect statues in order to give himself an excuse to send the federal government into a city against the wishes of the mayor and state governor. He places them directly in the path of the protests, deliberately encouraging conflicts between protesters and the feds. A few kidnappings into unmarked vans later, Trump decided he's collected enough video clips for FOX News and withdraws. Things immediately settle down.

Trump doesn't give a fuck about those statues, but he knows the mouthbreathing conservative culture warriors do. How fucking blatant is that? Everyone on the left and in the center should be outraged by this. Everyone on the right, fuck you.

**edit:**

I think my original post was maybe too focused on the timeline in Oregon, which is important to the story, but not quite as alarming as the executive order protecting statues which is really what makes this whole thing fascist.

Executive Order 13933, Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence, **has been interpreted as allowing federal officers to be deployed without the permission of individual U.S. states.** It's also been used to authorize domestic surveillance.

I don't know how anybody could read about this and not be alarmed. This is without precedent. Don't take it from me, though. [Take it from FOX News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/judge-napolitano-operation-legend-federal-troops-chicago):

>“If the state officials or local officials consent to the introduction of federal assets on the streets and for law enforcement purposes there is no constitutional impediment,” [Judge Napolitano] explained. “But if they don't consent, then there is a constitutional impediment.”

I know we haven't always gotten along, progressives, leftists, liberals, centrists, libertarians, and so on. But please take a long hard look at the base principles of whichever ideology you favor.

I think the vast majority of people who hold those principles should be able to agree on this one thing. Right wingers, you're going to regret this path. Abandon your shit ideology and join the rest of the free world already.

**edit 2:**

The more I think about this, the worse it gets. What that executive order achieves:

1. There is no federal law prohibiting damage to state monuments and statues. There are state laws, but there's no federal law.

2. So the executive order creates a new type of ""forbidden"" behavior that was not forbidden before. Again, it's not a law or a crime at the federal level.

3. It authorizes the creation of a massive federal paramilitary force in order to enforce this new federal prohibition against the forbidden behavior.

4. The force can be deployed into states and cities even against the consent of the state and city government.

5. Destroying statues on state property is already a crime in every state, does that make this less bad? Yes. In a more charitable view, you could say that this is just the federal government enforcing the law on behalf of the state when the state itself refuses to do. Never mind that many cities were actually okay with the statues being destroyed and in many cases even announced that they would take them down themselves.

This will definitely be challenged in the courts, so it may yet be ruled unconstitutional. By the new 6-3 Supreme Court. If they find it constitutional, here's one potential way to state the precedent: ""An executive order can prohibit a behavior and enforce this under threat of violence, even against the will of state and local governments, so long as the prohibited behavior is already illegal in that state.""

This isn't good. One of tactics that city governments use to deal with protests and riots is to basically stop enforcing some petty crimes. Graffiti and minor vandalism particularly, or allowing statues to be destroyed which in many cities actually did a pretty damn good job of calming everyone down.

Now Trump can legally escalate any protest to violence in any American city. No meaningful protest can avoid producing some amount of graffiti, littering, vandalism, noise level laws. He can use it selectively too: aggressive and heavy handed federal involvement at BLM protests, no federal involvement at Proud Boys protests. ""Everyone has been calling these guys 'fascists' but at least they can protest peacefully, unlike the other side.""

This isn't a good path to be heading down. We've seen this before.",9/28/2020 4:48
Fox News and Trump supporters have already decided the New York Times report on Trump's taxes is fake news. Got me thinking....,4,j12d34,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j12d34/fox_news_and_trump_supporters_have_already/,7,1601282832,"A big problem with a lot of remaining Trump supporters is that they're happy enough with their individual lives that they don't see the need for candidates that promote change.

The things that upset them most in their day to day lives are the ""bad"" things they hear about that other people are doing. So they're going to vote for the person they think will stop the ""bad things"".

They are also heavily group focused and do not want to have an opinion that is different from their people. They trust their people and that someone has done the research even if they ""don't have time for that"".

If you had been a part of thier group and you disagree, it's assumed that you're changing groups and becoming brainwashed so your points will be dismissed.

So how do we actually win them over?

I think we have to make them think we're not too different from them whenever possible. And speak only to the things that affect them directly or morally infuriate them.

If they're a one policy voter with abortion- talk to them about how you used to be ""pro life"" too until you read about it and learned that more people are supported in their and their babies lives through the pro choice movement.

If they are worried about their taxes going up and the government being too big, talk about how Trump has not helped in those departments and how Biden's tax plan is actually more favorable for them.

They don't care about our causes. We have to convince them on grounds that matter to them.

Alternative to Court Packing,3,j0shwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j0shwh/alternative_to_court_packing/,4,1601247578,"1. Eliminate a set number of Justices.\*
2. Have a president nominate a new justice in the first and third year of their term.
3. Establish implied consent from the Senate after six months.
4. Set a term limit of twenty years from when this law is established.
5. Set some minimum qualification requirements for Judges and Justices; Such as rated qualified by the American Bar Association.

It would eliminate the uncertainty of how many justices get nominated by a single president. It would make the court less 'swingy' and more steady. This is a less partisan method of improving the court in the long term. It does not set a precedent of just increasing the number of justices every presidency and does not further entrench the court as a partisan institution.

So what do you guys think?

I'm a Pennsylvania registered voter but moving out of state next week. It's a temporary move so I'm still a PA resident and not the state I'm moving to (NY). I'll be there past the election 

I want to make sure I vote for Biden!

I'm already signed up for VBM from the primary. I will be here when early in person voting starts on 9/29, but leaving next day. So VBM ballots are supposed to start going out on 9/29, I will obviously not be here when it gets delivered

How can I still cast this vote?

I know early in person starts on 9/29. But isn't that for voters who haven't requested VBM only? I thought my mail ballot would have just been mailed out by 9/29, so I can't use in person early. I'm not sure, if anyone knows?

Or can I change the address where my VBM is sent? If they can send to my temporary address in NY that's perfect, but I wasn't sure. Anyone know?

Or perhaps request an excuse absentee? But again but sure if my current VBM ballot being sent prevents that.

Thanks if anyone is able to help",9/25/2020 14:09

I'm going by the rule of thumb that it's more effective to give directly to the candidates themselves than say, the DNC for them to use however. I tried to generically search for advise that might give a little bit more of bird's eye view over all the races, but came up short. So if you had say, $100, (I intend to give more, ) how would you spread it strategically over the tighest or most vital races? Of course every race is important, but maybe you have insights or resources into who actually needs the money more right now?

I've used Actblue for Biden a few times, and given a little to Amy McGrath, but recently heard that she may not be able to overtake McConnell, and the money could be better used elsewhere? I also heard that Harrison running against Lindsey actually has plenty of money, and the polls are still tight AF. So I'm just skeptical.

So I just had a sudden idea and wanted to see if anyone has any suggestions or experience with something like this.

I’m currently enrolled in a community college in rural Kansas. Campus is pretty dead but ppl still are still on campus for class, so I had this idea of setting up a table and setting up a couple laptops that people can stop by to quickly register to vote (our deadline to register is October 13). Hold up a couple signs to call people over and let them know what we’re there for and yeah. 


The thing is that I’m not very involved with my campus or any organizations. I’m assuming I would have to ask some official from the school to be able to do this. I’m not a very social person, in fact I’m pretty shy but I feel very strongly in sticking it to Trump supporters here in this town and getting people to register. Especially since I know that if a lot of us younger people get together we might bare substantial weight in this election.

Any opinions, suggestions? Is this even reasonable or should i leave it alone and let someone else better versed take care of it? How would my school take it if I asked them? 

I was thinking this doesn’t have to be a big deal, but maybe I’m wrong and there’s a lot more to it? After all, I don’t really see any political groups in my town trying to get people to register or anything so maybe there’s a reason for that.",9/25/2020 9:44

What are your opinions on Puerto Rico becoming a state?,1,izaubk,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/izaubk/what_are_your_opinions_on_puerto_rico_becoming_a/,1,1601028216,"Hey all. So I’m a Hispanic-American living in Puerto Rico. As of now I am grimly witnessing what was the slow descent of what was left of American Democracy turn into a full blown high-speed train headed to fascism and I can do absolutely diddly squat about it because I don’t have a say when it comes to the presidential election. I can vote for exactly zero senators, and can only vote for a single-non-voting representative in the House (she can only vote in assigned committees). On the other hand, the outcome of the whole election will directly impact what happens over here, negatively or positively. We are 3.1 million Americans in a state of limbo where we are not our own country and therefore cannot trade with other countries, but we also can’t participate in any meaningful way in the laws that Congress approves over us or over the nation as a whole. 


I wanted to ask y’all directly. What are your thoughts on admitting Puerto Rico as a state? 

Before you answer here are some facts:

1. Puerto Rico is about the size of Iowa. It would have 6 electoral votes. 

2. I can see Puerto Rico as a lean D state, having 1-2 Dem Senators and 2-3 Dem representatives, depending on the election year. 

3. Essentially, we lean Democrat, but we could easily go Republican if it’s a wave year and with the right messaging. Similarly to a smaller Michigan or Pennsylvania.",9/25/2020 6:03

DEEP STATE?,1,iz49ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iz49ly/deep_state/,1,1601005448,"So, I have a question. If Democrats are all part of a ""deep state"" conspiracy, is it the lamest of all overthrows of any government anywhere? Everything the Democrats have done since trump has been in office has been a colossal failure. How can you take over a government with all the following rules and working within the boundaries of the law. 
I mean if you are going to overthrow a government you would need a charismatic leader that could make people believe whatever he wants, you would want to devide the nation and make your followers feel as if there very life is at stake and the other half of the nation wants to subjugate every aspect of there lives. You want to get leaders of your party to fall lock step in behind you. Skirt the law, convince your followers that you are exactly like they are even though it should be obvious that he is nothing like you. Start saying that everything the other party does is in antithesis of what you belive and you need to defend it to save the world. Start saying that if the other party wins it can only be because they cheated and lied. Then you, yourself lie, lie, lie never admit fault or weakness. If some disagrees with you or your agenda start blowing the dog whistles and destroy them. Push, push,push don't stop never pass up an opportunity to denigrate and sow seeds of doubt and discontent. Change the rules to meet your needs. Make small changes that no one would suspect anything until all the rules have been change to benefit you. And finally get help from an enemy state. 
Democrats haven't done any of these things, so I guess we need to get on the ball before the Republicans do....this.....shit!",9/24/2020 23:44

Donald Underwood?,1,iyzao2,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iyzao2/donald_underwood/,6,1600989960,"Hi,


So I’ve been following the press titles regarding the Supreme Court judges and Trump. I didn’t really understand it really. Tried to read some articles but none of them is “non-US-citizen- friendly”. Can someone explains what happened exactly, and how is that affecting the elections? The reason why I’m asking is that I’m in the final episodes of House of Cards S05 (not gonna see S06) and there are lots of similarities between the psychopaths that are Trump and Francis underwood. 

Their manipulative, anti-social (in the psychological context) personality made it hard for me to ignore the fact the House of Cards is actually predicting what’s gonna happen in the near future.

Making phone calls and having one on one conversations is the most effective way of securing someone's vote and support.

Here below is the link to all of our Phonebank Timeslots coming up (they are in EST). If you have any questions or have any other way you would like to help, please shoot me a private message. Thank you for your time!

I watched American citizens and reporters get beaten and gassed illegally. I watched it be done by local police, military, and federal forces. I got pissed off.

My eyes have been opened and I can't unsee the travesty occurring in our country right now. Now we need your help. [Volunteer here.](https://www.continuetoserve.vet/get-involved) [Our website here.](https://www.continuetoserve.vet)

&#x200B;

On June 1st, I watched something I had never personally witnessed. I watched people, citizens, reporters, journalists, photographers, peacefully protesting or doing their jobs reporting the news, be beaten, gassed, and shot with rubber bullets. I had blackhawks hovering over my house and a city I have come to love and call home was flooded with thousands of federal officers and military personnel. It was a small taste of what martial law would be like. And as a combat veteran, as someone who has lost people overseas in what I now believe were useless and unnecessary wars, I did not sign up, deploy, and lose friends, my mental health, my own family upon my return, so that I could watch a President utterly destroy the very fabric our nation was founded on.

On June 2nd, myself and a fellow veteran I deployed with went to BLM Plaza to stand in solidarity with the BLM movement and for the rights of all Americans to protest and exercise their 1A right to free speech. We stood because we believed that the military should never be used on US soil to silence a free people with rights. This is not the America I grew up believing in. So we stood. 

Having never organized before, having never gone to a protest, I had no idea what to do or what to expect. We've now been out there for 3 months. Standing with, supporting local BLM grassroots orgs, and now we are on the brink of establishing our own 501c3 to continue our mission. We are Continue To Serve, a veteran-based nonprofit, focused on social justice issues and community service. We stand for the rights of all citizens and intend to remember our oath to support and defend the Constitution and the citizens it represents. 

I'm not asking for donations. I am asking for something more valuable, we need your time, your energy, your expertise. Veterans, please join us in standing up for what is right and calling out what is wrong. We are a direct action organization, but in time, we are planning on establishing training and education platforms, community service support systems, and we will expand into more than just the BLM Movement and the Vote. There are many issues that need our attention and veterans can no longer sit idle and stay quiet. We must stand. Please join us. No matter where in the country you are, we can use your help.

**WHO TO NOT DONATE TO**

Amy McGrath of Kentucky 
I loath Mitch McConnell, but if polls are any indication, McGrath can not win, it is not worth it to spend money on this race, it's sad, but the next best thing to replacing McConnell is making him lose control of the senate 

Doug Jones of Alabama 
It pains me to say this, but Jones is losing, there's not anything that can be done about it. Alabama is red as hell and it's just a waste of money. I love Jones and wouldn't trade his last three years representing Alabama for anything, but it was always borrowed time. (I'm hoping he gets picked for Attorney General)

John Hickenlooper of Colorado 
Full stop, Gardner is done, Hickenlooper will win in Colorado no matter what, which is good because it's more money to other senate races

Mark Kelly of Arizona 
Mark Kell is up against McSally, BY DOUBLE DIGITS. Kelly has all the money he needs, this seat is another safe Dem pickup 

**WHO TO SEND MONEY TOO**

Alaska may be red but it's also very independent and that's who Gross is, and independent with the backing of the democratic party. Polls shows a race with many undecideds but ultimately this is a long shot. If you want to, give the good Doctor some moeny

Dr. Barbara Bollier of Kansas https://bollierforkansas.com
Another doctor and another long shot. While Kobach is unfortunately not her opponent, polls still show a close race. I wish we had more but until then she's not a bad investment 

Mike Espy of Mississippi https://espyforsenate.com
Another long shot but a possible pickup if we're lucky. He came close in the special election in 2018 so here's to hoping he wins.

MJ Hegar of Texas https://mjfortexas.com
Texas is trending blue, and while Cornyn is not as disliked as Cruz, he is also not as well known. Polls aren't the best but there's a possibility here. Fingers crossed 

That's it for now. All other seats are safe for both democrats and republicans. Please give what you can and even volunteer

The past two rep presidents didn’t win the popular vote. George bush won when Florida (run by his brother Jeb) said they miscounted the votes and it was too close to call. Then W (from an oil family) sent America to war with a country based on the lie that they had weapons of mass destrucion. Iraq never did.  They had oil which we annexed and they had death for thousands of Americans. Bush lied. Got what he wanted and thousands died. 

Donald also didn’t win the popular vote. He won when Russia interfered in the election and got him the win. This, in addition to years of gerrymandering districts to benefit republican outcomes and making it virtually impossible for low income citizens to vote in republican urban areas got him the win. Now he has assigned one of his largest financial donors to run the post office to manage mail in ballots. For the epidemic, Donald  admitted he lied to the American people that it was not so bad. He lied and hundreds of Thousands more Americans died. 

The republican head of the senate blocked the assignment of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee for a whole year saying it was too close to an election to vote. And now with less than two months to an election he is trying to force one in. Cheating. They make third grader excuses and say everyone does it and keep doing it. They ignore congressional subpoenas because they know they would be convicted. They suppress and attack scientific facts because they know their extremist beliefs are wrong. Cheating. 
The Republican Party can not win anything on a fair playing field so they cheat. Consistently. Year after year so they can get what they want at the expense of the rest of the country. 

They are so far from American Law and freedom they make the Taliban look like missionaries. This cult of right wing religious extremism must be stopped if our country is to stay free.",9/22/2020 16:59

Be brave!

We are facing the greatest challenge since World War II, we stand in the midst of darkness. The pandemic is taking countless lives due to the greatest dereliction of duty by a President in the history of America and those who follow him. The economic consequences will be felt for years to come as will the grief for every American lost. There will be a need to care for those who will have suffered permanent damage to their lungs and hearts. Not to mention the psychological trauma this period will have caused on thousands of Americans. Children all across America will need all the support we can give them to get them back on track in school, young adults will need support to get their careers back on track. All this as we must, absolutely must, tackle the crisis of global warming head on.

Be full of Hope!

I am full of hope, even as we stand in the midst of darkness, while the Republicans are clawing their hooks into the Supreme Court, and the pandemic rages on, I am full of hope. 

I am hopefull because people all across America have had it. They've had it with draconian Republican policies that no longer are tolerable. The republican party has been leaning on anti abortion, anti health care, anti financial aid, anti LGBTG  rights, anti climate and anti truth for too long and people have had it. People have had it with republican cronyism and self dealing. People have had it with the President and the Senate who serve themselves and wall street over the stakeholders of this nation.

Work arduously!

We are ahead in crucial senate races, in particular in Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado. When we win those races we take the senate. Recent polling shows we are competitive in Alaska, Montana, Kansas, Texas, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina. Let's us get right on it because America deserves better, America wants better.

This is the election were we beat back the darkness, this is the election were we retake the senate, the presidency and keep the house and get this nation back on track. 

Sleep sound at night knowing that there is hope in the midst of darkness and wake to work for the change America needs.",9/22/2020 4:40
Democrat Agenda for first 100 days,12,ixcyt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ixcyt1/democrat_agenda_for_first_100_days/,10,1600763420,"There is no doubt that the Republicans have been re-writing rules to allow them to maintain their minority rule (evidence in stacking federal judges after refusing hearings with Obama, stealing the Garland seat and then reversing with RBG). Here are my thoughts on what the democrat administration needs to do to restore democracy. This assumes Biden wins and we take back at least 50 seats in the Senate.

1. Get rid of the filibuster. Republicans aren't interested in norms or rules and the dems should stop playing by the old rules. In order to restore order to the republic with reform, this rule needs to go.
2. Term limits on Supreme Court judges. I know a lot of folks talk about packing the court, but the challenge is the death spiral this creates. When republicans get power back they'd just do the same, so we'd go from 9 to 11 to 13 and so on. Term limits could accomplish the same goal. If set at 16 years, effective immediately, it would boot Thomas, Robert and Altito- along with Breyer. This would give the dems a 5-4 advantage in the first term. 
3. Statehood for DC and consider splitting California into two states. Red states have way too much power overall, relative to population. The only way to level this playing field is to add to the field. By adding 2 - 4 safe democratic seats, the senate will be more reflective of the US population.
4. Get rid of the electoral college. Small population center states votes count more than dense states. The electoral college is the only reason republicans have won in the recent past. Every vote should be equal in the presidential election.
5. New voter rights laws, including federal rules restricting Gerrymandering. Clearly the dems need to restore voter rights that the Supreme Court knocked down. But, in addition, we have to stop the blatant gerrymandering. I'm not sure the answer, but the crazy shapes to ensure a democrat or republican victory have to go. Gerrymandering allows for more 'safe' districts where a party can run an extreme candidate and win. This encourages more and more extreme candidates that aren't beholden to the people because they can't be voted out. Get rid of this and we can reduce extreme politics (and maybe, just maybe the parties will start working together occasionally).
6. New laws on the media to make them accountable for their reporting. Opinion shows rule the cable news network and Fox has no journalist integrity. Hannity will report on conspiracy theories like they are fact and then does not retract when they are proven false. There has to be penalties for spreading false information without equal time retracting the information (on the same show). This should extent to FB, BTW.

&#x200B;

Once you have all of this done, the democrats need to move fast on health care, tax reform and corruption laws. But without the above done, we'll be hanging from fingertips every 2-4 years.  Government needs to work for the people, not the few, special interests and the rich. Biden and team will need to have some courage to pass all of these suggestions and, if they do, the country could become sane again.",9/22/2020 4:30

I know the likelihood of Mike Espy winning in Mississippi are low, even with the polls and all. But this just shows how a Blue wave is coming to drown Moscow Mitch and his henchmen.

My understanding is that fundraising practices for political campaigns are pretty heavily regulated. So my question is: is the Trump campaign using illegal practices, and if so, why is no one taking it to court?

**Details**

I thought it would be interesting to sign up for Trump emails and texts. Interesting it was, but also kinda scary. And more specifically, full of lies and deception. Beyond being angry about this (somehow it really boiled my blood that he's taking advantage of his own supporters), it really seems like it should be illegal to lie in your campaign fundraising. I'm especially interested in verifying these ""700% match"" claims. Here are a few specific example snippets (with real name redacted):

Texts:

“2016, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait to the next election.”

2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): “I don’t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.”

2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): “The very balance of our nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.”

2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice.” 

2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): “The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.”

2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): “In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.” 

2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.”

2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.”

2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): “I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.”

2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): “I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.””",9/21/2020 13:43

"Could a Democratic House and Senate (with some help) impeach and convict Trump between Jan 3 and Jan 20, 2021?",0,iwx6eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iwx6eq/could_a_democratic_house_and_senate_with_some/,8,1600709523,"I don't think this is a likely scenario. But is it possible? Nothing about the next few months is going to be typical, all kinds of shenanigans may happen. Many Democrats in power appear to have realized that restricting their strategies to any honored conventions other than the actual law and Constitution puts them at disadvantage to aggressive Republican tactics.

Winners of the November 2020 election will be sworn in on these dates:

New senators are sworn in Jan 3, 2021.

Source: [Wikipedia - 2020 US Senate elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_Senate_elections)

New representatives sessions also start Jan 3.

BUT, any new president would not be inaugurated, until January 20, 2021.

Source: [Wikipedia - US Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election)

ERGO: From January 3, 2021 until January 20, 2021, there would be a window of time where a Democratic majority in the House and Senate could both impeach President Trump - even if Trump was a lame duck president.

Granted a Senate conviction even with a Democratic majority would be difficult, given the need for 2/3 votes to convict. But as the majority, Democrats would have new power to highlight Trump's impeached behavior and pressure or persuade Republican's to help.

Last note: If Trump were convicted in January by the Senate, but had won the election, his ability to take up office on January 20, 2021 would still depend on a separate vote by the Senate on whether to prevent him from ever being able to hold office again. That would seem certain after a conviction given a Democratic majority and this quote from the source below:

Some issues I expect with this are:

* finding enough liberals willing and able to move from a blue state to Wyoming
* the cost involved in subsidizing the massive migration

This Is What Republicans Previously Said About Appointing SCOTUS Justices During An Election Year,13,iwd7a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iwd7a1/this_is_what_republicans_previously_said_about/,7,1600634712,"**Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO):** “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.” 

**Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC):** “In this election year, the  American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the  future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy  left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a  new president.” 

**Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX):**  “I believe the American people deserve to have a voice in the  selection of the next Supreme Court Justice, and the best way to ensure  that happens is to have the Senate consider a nomination made by the  next President.

Confirming a new Supreme Court Justice during a presidential election  year for a vacancy arising that same year is not common in our nation’s  history; the last time it happened was in 1932. And it has been almost  130 years since a presidential election year nominee was confirmed for a  vacancy arising the same year under divided government as we have  today.""

**Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX):** “It has been 80 years since a  Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year.  There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

**Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA):** “We will see what the people say this fall and our next president, regardless of party, will be making that nomination.” 

**Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO):** “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision."" 

**Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC):** “If an opening comes in  the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has  started, we’ll wait to the next election” 

**Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA):** “A lifetime appointment  that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the  direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get  bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a  voice.” 

**Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND):** “There is 80 years of  precedent for not nominating and confirming a new justice of the Supreme  Court in the final year of a president’s term so that people can have a  say in this very important decision.” 

**Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK):** “It makes the current  presidential election all that more important as not only are the next  four years in play, but an entire generation of Americans will be  impacted by the balance of the court and its rulings. Sens. Barack  Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid have all  made statements that the Senate does not have to confirm presidential  nominations in an election year. I will oppose this nomination as I  firmly believe we must let the people decide the Supreme Court’s  future.” 

**Sen. David Perdue (R-GA):** “The very balance of our  nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the  president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear  from the American people.” 

**Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH):** “I believe the best thing  for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who  should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court  for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the  Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a  presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president  was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential  election year.” 

**Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL):** “I don’t think we should be  moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term — I would  say that if it was a Republican president .” 

**Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC):** “Vice President Biden’s  remarks may have been voiced in 1992, but they are entirely applicable  to 2016. The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the  institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not  launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during  the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to  elect our next president.” 

**Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA):** “The next Court appointment should be made by the newly-elected president.”

If Trump loses and Republicans lose the senate, ole Moscow Mitch will still try to jam a nomination down America’s throat. Judicial nominees(all appointed positions) has been Mitchy’s game for over a decade.

Mark Kelly is currently favored by 538’s model 78/22. This election by far is a Dems best chance of unseating a Republican. Right now Dems need 4 Republicans to break rank to defeat the Republican senate. If Mark wins, Dems only need 3. It looks like Republican senators in Maine and Alaska will not vote with their party before the election or after if Biden wins. It’s likely that Dems could pick up 1 more if Biden wins.

Further, he is the wife of Rep. Gabby Gifford who was shot while in office, a combat pilot, and an astronaut. Decent resume if I do say so. Plus, he would fill the seat of late Sen. McCain who we all saw do the right thing with his vote to repeal Obamacare.

Obviously this all hinges on Biden winning, but it’s the easiest thing we can do right now while on Reddit before we can formulate a full strategy now that the election has changed. 

Finally, donate to all Dems that you believe in or that we need. This is a suggestion if you have limited funds and you want to get the best bang for your buck. 

Disclaimer: I live in WA and I do not work for nor am I affiliated with the Kelly campaign. I love political strategy and the law. I graduated with a Poli Sci degree and then went on to law school and passed the bar exam.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait to the next election.”

2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): “I don’t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.”

2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): “The very balance of our nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.”

2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice.” 

2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): “The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.”

2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): “In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.” 

2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.”

2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.”

2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): “I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.”

2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): “I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.”

2016, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky)

Increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court to reverse GOP court packing and how to message about it,1,iw03og,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iw03og/increasing_the_number_of_seats_on_the_supreme/,0,1600575915,"Everyone needs to start recognizing and talking about the fact that the GOP has been packing the courts, including the Supreme Court, for the past 10 years.

If the Democrats win the Presidency and Senate in November there will be a big push from the base to abandon the filibuster and increase the number of seat on the Supreme Court to pack it with left wing judges. This was already talked about before RBG died, and will be absolutely necessary if Trump and McConnell fill her seat. Obama talked about dropping the filibuster during his speech at John Lewis's funeral. The idea isn't new.

What we need to start doing NOW is preparing the ground rhetorically for increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court. The media, the GOP, and politically non-engaged people will decry this at cheating, and court packing. We need to start preparing to counter this argument.

The fact is that the GOP has been court packing ever since 2012. If increasing the number of seats on a court and filling them with like minded judges is court packing, then so is preventing existing seats from being filled under the Constitutionally proscribed process because the person filling them would appoint judges you don't like until a like minded President is elected to fill those seats.

Mitch McConnell packed the Supreme Court when he prevented Obama from naming a replacement for Scalia's seat. He packed the lower courts when he spent 6 years blocking judicial appointments. The past decade of GOP control of the Senate has seen the most egregious court packing in US history. Democrats increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court and lower courts isn't court packing, it's reversing the court packing the GOP has been practicing for a decade.

Everyone should write their Democratic Senators and Senate candidates and express this view. Don't ask them to pack the Supreme Court. Ask them to increase the seats to reverse the court packing the GOP has gotten away with. Frame it like this every single time you talk about it.",9/20/2020 0:25

The AvengeHer Plan,3,ivzrxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ivzrxv/the_avengeher_plan/,0,1600574794,"(First, abolish the filibuster.)

1. The lower circuit courts of appeals have a wild disparity in number of judges in relation to population. The 11th circuit has one judge for every 2.7 million people while the 10th circuit has one judge for every 1.4 million. This should be made uniform, 1 judge for every million people in a circuit, with a circuit capped at 21 judges with a minimum of 11. Every ten years after the census the courts should be expanded to account for population growth.
2. That means that there should be approximately 332 appeals court judges not 179. This should be spread over 16 circuit courts not 12 plus the Federal and DC Circuit courts which should be brought up to the maximum of 21 judges. This means we need to confirm 172 new appeals court judges to bring population balance to the appeals courts.
3. The Supreme Court use to have a judge to account for each circuit court. Today each Supreme Court Justices is assigned a circuit court to cover with some having to cover multiple courts. This is an unreasonable burden to place on the justices so the court should be expanded so there is one Supreme Court justice for every circuit court.
4. That means there should be 18 Supreme Court Justices and we'll need to confirm an additional 9 justices to meet the requirements of the new law. Every ten years after the census a Supreme Court member will be added to account for any growth in the circuit courts.

We will be establishing some much needed equal representation to the circuit courts and returning the Supreme Court to its traditional role of representing the size of the circuit courts. It's a reasonable plan based on tradition and equality of representation. Also Fuck Mitch McConnell.",9/20/2020 0:06

#VOTE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE
---
####Mail-In Voting aka Absentee Voting

As of today, MN, VA, SD and WY join PA in beginning early voting to defeat the most dangerous President in history. Make no mistake, this is the most important election of our lives. Nearly all states have expanded mail-in voting eligibility to all citizens, with most states automatically mailing ballots or ballot applications to everyone. If you have not received one, [request your absentee ballot now.](https://www.vote.org/) Nearly all states have waved any requirements for witness/notary for mail-in ballots this election, **however MO has not!** If you live in MO, make a plan now on how to safely vote. (If you know of any other states that have restrictions on voting, please share details in the comments.)

####In-Person Voting

Early voting has begun! Most states are strongly discouraging in-person voting this election due to the pandemic. Check your local state's websites to see if in-person early voting is still available, as many states have switched to mail-in ballot drop-off only. If you choose to vote in-person, first check your voter registration, polling place and any other voting requirements in your state such as an ID. [Currently, most states can request and some require a form of ID to vote in-person.](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx)

####Register to Vote

Voter registration is still open for all 50 states. The first states begin closing voter registration starting Oct 4th, so don't wait! If you haven't yet, now is the time to register, and get your friends and family registered too: https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/

####Election Protection

If you experience harassment, intimidation, or anyone trying to prevent you from voting, report it to Election Protection Hotline (866-687-8683) immediately. No matter what, under federal law you always have the right to cast a provisional ballot, so there is no reason not to try and vote. Make sure you're at the right polling location: in 27 states, if you cast a provisional ballot at the wrong polling location, your vote will not be counted.

* DONATE to Biden/Harris or your local fav. ANY amount is welcome.
* PUT UP THE SIGN in your yard and the sticker on your car.
* CORRECT MISINFORMATION / false statements in conversations (but check your emotions).
* Get other Dems to register and VOTE.
* Don't be afraid to SPEAK THE TRUTH on social media (and make sure it is the truth).
* VOLUNTEER any time you can to the candidate of your choice.

I was just push-polled from Pennsylvania,6,iu2dd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iu2dd8/i_was_just_pushpolled_from_pennsylvania/,4,1600312466,"I was just push-polled from Pennsylvania.  Even though I live in Seattle I still have the same Pittsburgh cell number I've owned for 20 years.  Some highlights of the call:

* Cold call from a Pittsburgh Area code (412)
* Caller spoke perfect English but had an Indian accent. He was extremely polite and spoke loudly and slowly
* Asked for me by firstname, middlename, lastname  Only about 4 people on Earth know my middle name.  I wonder if this gives insight into how they got my info. 

I told him that I was no longer available at this number but that I love surveys and would gladly take one. 

* He asked me some basic questions regarding if I am registered and if I plan to vote in 2020
* Asked if I was ""locked in"" to my choice or if I could have my mind changed
* Asked how locked in I felt I was

(He very specifically used the word ""party"" for everyone but Trump)

* Asked who I was thinking of voting for.  List of candidates went Dario Hunter, Green Party; Joe Biden, Democratic Party; Donald J Trump, Republican; Jo Jorgensen, Libertarian party

* Favorability of Biden
* Favorability of Trump
* Favorability of Pelosi
* Policy details on a favorability scale. A typical kind of question would be

> Very favorable, Somewhat favorable, Neutral, Somewhat unfavorable, very unfavorable: Instituting a tax plan that would raise taxes on every American while damaging the economy and harming small business

* Questions were primarily economic focused
* Opinion on the favorability scale of ""Hunter Biden and the Biden family using lobbying money and Russian bribes to enrich themselves at the expense of the American people.""

* Opinion on favorability scale of Donald Trumps performance as president
* Opinion on direction of the country
* Opinion on direction of the economy
* Opinion on Trumps economy performance
* Opinion on Trumps security performance
* Opinion on Trumps wildfire performance
* Opinion on Trumps Coronavirus performance
* Which candidate would do better on Defense, which on economy, which on Coronavirus, which on environment, which on corruption

(I thought this next one was strange)

* If you had to choose between two candidates, A and B, where A was a nice guy who means well but was an ineffective lifetime politician, leader of a corrupt family and in bed with a liberal agenda and B was not the nicest person but always had the best interests of the American people at heart and could project strength while keeping the economy strong, which would you pick?

* Favorability of different tax policy propositions. The propositions basically involved ""A a tax plan that would [do very bad sounding things]"" (for stuff that was obviously Biden or ""This proposal that would [do very nice sounding things] "" (for stuff that was obviously Trump)

* Would you vote for a candidate who was going to attack social security and healthcare benefits, and enact policies that would put many Americans over 75 on the street, including those making less than $30K a year

* Once again, who are you planning to vote for in November.
* How certain are you about that vote
* Demographic data - since I told him I wasn't me he took my full name, age bracket, income bracket, urban/suburban/rural, ethnicity, marital status
* Who did you vote for in 2016

TBH I'm not sure how anyone falls for these.

Edit: I have been getting hammered with solicitations from both parties.  Democratic stuff is usually a text message asking me to vote. They usually come in at supremely annoying times about 4-5am for me.  Republican stuff is through the phone mainly but rarely through text.  Phone stuff are polls.  I get polled about 2x weekly now.  I get a text usually during primetime for sports. The texts are almost always guilt trippy. 

I was registered dem from 2004-2016, switched to independent after 2016 primary.  If anyone on the Biden campaign is interested reads this sub, I get a lot of these and I could record them for you.

Edit 2: I almost wonder if this was a low key GOTV call for wavering 2016 Trump voters. I'm shocked they mentioned Hunter Biden when the Trump clan is corrupt to its nepotistic core. I was also surprised they didn't bring out the Supreme Court arguments.

Im sharing this here because I think the topic is very interesting and would like to hear from others who gets these and learn more about push-polling in general.",9/16/2020 23:14

===========  
The term originates in the systematic psychological manipulation of a victim by her husband in Patrick Hamilton’s 1938 stage play Gas Light, and the film adaptations released in 1940 and 1944. In the story, the husband attempts to convince his wife and others that she is insane by manipulating small elements of their environment and insisting that she is mistaken, remembering things incorrectly, or delusional when she points out these changes. The play's title alludes to how the abusive husband slowly dims the gas lights in their home, while pretending nothing has changed, in an effort to make his wife doubt her own perceptions. The wife repeatedly asks her husband to confirm her perceptions about the dimming lights, but in defiance of reality, he keeps insisting that the lights are the same and instead it is she who is going insane.  


We are living in a perpetual state of gaslighting. The reality that we are being told by the media is at complete odds with what we are seeing with our own two eyes. And when we question the false reality that we are being presented, or we claim that what we see is that actual reality, we are vilified as racist or bigots or just plain crazy. You’re not racist. You’re not crazy. You’re being gaslighted.  


New York State has twice as many deaths from Covid-19 than any other state, and New York has accounted for one fifth of all Covid-19 deaths, but we are told that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has handled the pandemic better than any other governor. But if we support policies of Governors whose states had only a fraction of the infections and deaths as New York, we’re called anti-science and want people to die. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


We see mobs of people looting stores, smashing windows, setting cars on fire and burning down buildings, but we are told that these demonstrations are peaceful protests. And when we call this destruction of our cities, riots, we are called racists. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


We see the major problem destroying many inner-cities is crime; murder, gang violence, drug dealing, drive-by shootings, armed robbery, but we are told that it is not crime, but the police that are the problem in the inner-cities. We are told we must defund the police and remove law enforcement from crime-riddled cities to make them safer. But if we advocate for more policing in cities overrun by crime, we are accused of being white supremacists and racists. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


The United States of America accepts more immigrants than any other country in the world. The vast majority of the immigrants are “people of color”, and these immigrants are enjoying freedom and economic opportunity not available to them in their country of origin, but we are told that the United States is the most racist and oppressive country on the planet, and if we disagree, we are called racist and xenophobic. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Capitalist countries are the most prosperous countries in the world The standard of living is the highest in capitalist countries. We see more poor people move up the economic ladder to the middle and even the wealthy class through their effort and ability in capitalist countries than any other economic system in the world, but we are told capitalism is an oppressive system designed to keep people down. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Communist countries killed over 100 million people in the 20th century. Communist countries strip their citizens of basic human rights, dictate every aspect of their lives, treat their citizens like slaves, and drive their economies into the ground, but we are told that Communism is the fairest, most equitable, freest and most prosperous economic system in the world. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


The most egregious example of gaslighting is the concept of “white fragility”. You spend your life trying to be a good person, trying to treat people fairly and with respect. You disavow racism and bigotry in all its forms. You judge people solely on the content of their character and not by the color of their skin. You don’t discriminate based on race or ethnicity. But you are told you are a racist, not because of something you did or said, but solely because of the color of your skin. You know instinctively that charging someone with racism because of their skin color is itself racist. You know that you are not racist, so you defend yourself and your character, but you are told that your defense of yourself is proof of your racism. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you’re being gaslighted.  


Gaslighting has become one of the most pervasive and destructive tactics in American politics. It is the exact opposite of what our political system was meant to be. It deals in lies and psychological coercion, and not the truth and intellectual discourse. If you ever ask yourself if you’re crazy, you are not. Crazy people aren’t sane enough to ask themselves if they’re crazy. So, trust yourself, believe what’s in your heart. Trust your eyes over what you are told. Never listen to the people who tell you that you are crazy, because you are not, you’re being gaslighted.  


Sophocles said: ""What people believe prevails over the truth.""  


And that's what the media are trying to exploit.

For comparison, my mom had to plead with him to quit talking politics at Thanksgiving. 

Dad also just got laid off from his lucrative blue collar job. He’s always been a midwestern labor guy but became very skeptical about the Mexicans coming to take his job, which was the impetus for his voting for Trump. Now that he’s without one, it seems he’s returning to his union roots.

"Today on Senator McCain's funeral,only one living president is not invited : Donald Trump. Till this day he didn't apologize to McCain's family or the POWs for trashing all those members in uniform who were captured and tortured by our enemies.",984,9c2tsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9c2tsl/today_on_senator_mccains_funeralonly_one_living/,27,1535835251,"In an Op-Ed in today's NYT ""Straining to Keep Faith with America"" Bret Stephens has trashed Trump in no uncertain terms by adding this in his piece ""John McCain knew that we are better than Trump.""

To that I like to add my own thoughts saying that maybe, I emphasize the word ""maybe"" again to say that maybe a healthy Senator McCain could put a stop to a marauding president called Trump. 

But with the Republican Senator John McCain's death, there is nothing that can stop Trump from destroying each and every American values that this country developed over two centuries plus more.

Even a Republican president Ronald Reagan's description of America was much different from Trump's vision.

By quoting a phrase from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Reagan declared that our country is like ""a shining city on a hill"".

But since Trump took over the presidency, every Americans are ""straining to keep Faith with America"", the country they love dearly unlike Trump and his followers who only think of what they can get. 

Even Democratic president John Kennedy's words on his inauguration on January 20th, 1961, ""Ask not what your country can do for you_ask what can do for your country"", have no sway over the minds of these fake ""swamp cleaners"" like Trump. 

Trump is more interested in finding how much money he can milk from his presidency than giving some of his assets to the countrymen who were really struggling everyday to keep their faith on America.

Their struggles to keep faith on our institutions are four hundred times more now than before Trump took office on Jan 20th, '17.

That is the reason why we've to feel sorry for John McCain's permanent absence from an institution, mainly the Senate where he grilled each and every Trump's appointees and his cabinet members to hit hard at Trump's illogical policies.

Trump on the other hand didn't have the decency to go to McCain before his death or to his wife and families now to apologize saying, ""I should've never said that I don't care for people like you who got captured at war. As you know I didn't go to Vietnam for my bad foot. But I really appreciate your pains and sufferings due to terrible tortures at the hands of the Vietcong guerrillas. I'm really sorry that you endured those tortures for five plus years just to keep our country safe. May God bless your soul.""

Am I really dreaming that Trump would say those kind words and apologize to John McCain or his wife Cindy or his children or to all our POWs ?  Not in a million years ! No way .",9/1/2018 16:54

"Today on Senator McCain's funeral,only one living president is not invited : Donald Trump. Till this day he didn't apologize to McCain's family or the POWs for trashing all those members in uniform who were captured and tortured by our enemies.",984,9c2tsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9c2tsl/today_on_senator_mccains_funeralonly_one_living/,27,1535835251,"In an Op-Ed in today's NYT ""Straining to Keep Faith with America"" Bret Stephens has trashed Trump in no uncertain terms by adding this in his piece ""John McCain knew that we are better than Trump.""

To that I like to add my own thoughts saying that maybe, I emphasize the word ""maybe"" again to say that maybe a healthy Senator McCain could put a stop to a marauding president called Trump. 

But with the Republican Senator John McCain's death, there is nothing that can stop Trump from destroying each and every American values that this country developed over two centuries plus more.

Even a Republican president Ronald Reagan's description of America was much different from Trump's vision.

By quoting a phrase from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Reagan declared that our country is like ""a shining city on a hill"".

But since Trump took over the presidency, every Americans are ""straining to keep Faith with America"", the country they love dearly unlike Trump and his followers who only think of what they can get. 

Even Democratic president John Kennedy's words on his inauguration on January 20th, 1961, ""Ask not what your country can do for you_ask what can do for your country"", have no sway over the minds of these fake ""swamp cleaners"" like Trump. 

Trump is more interested in finding how much money he can milk from his presidency than giving some of his assets to the countrymen who were really struggling everyday to keep their faith on America.

Their struggles to keep faith on our institutions are four hundred times more now than before Trump took office on Jan 20th, '17.

That is the reason why we've to feel sorry for John McCain's permanent absence from an institution, mainly the Senate where he grilled each and every Trump's appointees and his cabinet members to hit hard at Trump's illogical policies.

Trump on the other hand didn't have the decency to go to McCain before his death or to his wife and families now to apologize saying, ""I should've never said that I don't care for people like you who got captured at war. As you know I didn't go to Vietnam for my bad foot. But I really appreciate your pains and sufferings due to terrible tortures at the hands of the Vietcong guerrillas. I'm really sorry that you endured those tortures for five plus years just to keep our country safe. May God bless your soul.""

Am I really dreaming that Trump would say those kind words and apologize to John McCain or his wife Cindy or his children or to all our POWs ?  Not in a million years ! No way .",9/1/2018 16:54

For comparison, my mom had to plead with him to quit talking politics at Thanksgiving. 

Dad also just got laid off from his lucrative blue collar job. He’s always been a midwestern labor guy but became very skeptical about the Mexicans coming to take his job, which was the impetus for his voting for Trump. Now that he’s without one, it seems he’s returning to his union roots.

"Today on Senator McCain's funeral,only one living president is not invited : Donald Trump.

To that I like to add my own thoughts saying that maybe, I emphasize the word ""maybe"" again to say that maybe a healthy Senator McCain could put a stop to a marauding president called Trump. 

But with the Republican Senator John McCain's death, there is nothing that can stop Trump from destroying each and every American values that this country developed over two centuries plus more.

Even a Republican president Ronald Reagan's description of America was much different from Trump's vision.

By quoting a phrase from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Reagan declared that our country is like ""a shining city on a hill"".

But since Trump took over the presidency, every Americans are ""straining to keep Faith with America"", the country they love dearly unlike Trump and his followers who only think of what they can get. 

Even Democratic president John Kennedy's words on his inauguration on January 20th, 1961, ""Ask not what your country can do for you_ask what can do for your country"", have no sway over the minds of these fake ""swamp cleaners"" like Trump. 

Trump is more interested in finding how much money he can milk from his presidency than giving some of his assets to the countrymen who were really struggling everyday to keep their faith on America.

Their struggles to keep faith on our institutions are four hundred times more now than before Trump took office on Jan 20th, '17.

That is the reason why we've to feel sorry for John McCain's permanent absence from an institution, mainly the Senate where he grilled each and every Trump's appointees and his cabinet members to hit hard at Trump's illogical policies.

Trump on the other hand didn't have the decency to go to McCain before his death or to his wife and families now to apologize saying, ""I should've never said that I don't care for people like you who got captured at war. As you know I didn't go to Vietnam for my bad foot. But I really appreciate your pains and sufferings due to terrible tortures at the hands of the Vietcong guerrillas. I'm really sorry that you endured those tortures for five plus years just to keep our country safe. May God bless your soul.""

Am I really dreaming that Trump would say those kind words and apologize to John McCain or his wife Cindy or his children or to all our POWs ?  Not in a million years ! No way .",9/1/2018 16:54

If you look more into the history of the life Hunter Biden has lived, he was in a car crash where he lost his mother and younger sister, and suffered a childhood brain injury. He then lost his only remaining sibling from Joe’s first marriage to brain cancer when Beau Biden passed in 2015. He has had anything but an easy life, and as someone who personally has had some struggles with substance use I found this to be disgraceful. How can we ever get past the mental health stigma when our president thinks someone’s child’s addiction is a means to discredit them in an argument? Especially when it’s so obvious as to why Hunter happened to turn to drug use? I knew trump was a disgrace, but this is a new low.",10/3/2020 22:18

Hopefully this is permissible in the community.  In any case, I'm serious.  I've already given more to Biden / Lincoln Project / Jaime Harrison than I've ever given to anyone during an Election year, but I can do a bit more.

Based on the number of people now coming out of that Rose Garden ceremony with positive tests, there were probably a WHOLE BUNCH of already infected people at the event, which assured that there was active virus all over the place for a very effective spread.

And why?  Because trump has led in a culture of unconcern about the reality and seriousness of the virus, and it is HIS LEADERSHIP that created this destructive situation.

Just wait till his lies about Climate Change (and so many other issues) become (more) clear.

"Opinion and Proposition: To ensure a speedy recovery from the coronavirus, President Trump should resign from office",14,j4hnpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j4hnpo/opinion_and_proposition_to_ensure_a_speedy/,21,1601770171,"I read earlier today that [Twiter will start suspending users wishing for Donald Trump's death after being diagnosed with COVID.](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitter-suspend-users-wishing-trump-dead-1234791263/)  I think this is valid, as COVID is a very dangerous disease that is devastating to a person's health and very painful, and could lead to death.  In fact, I encourage the opposite:  I wish Trump and other members of government including senators, representatives, cabinet members, and cabinet secretaries who are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus a speedy recovery and return to health.

But, running for office and running the government must be so incredibly stressful and exhausting, and complicated to do from a hospital bed.  On NPR yesterday, they said that Trump prefers receiving his security briefs in person, and being isolated in the hospital could complicate how the President receives his security briefings with his staff.

But I propose that President Trump need not worry about security briefs, and the other duties of president, by *resigning from office*.  Resigning from the Presidency will allow him to focus on getting better and healthy while he fights COVID.  He will need all of the strength that God can give him to battle his deadly disease.  Because, what's more important for President Trump?  That he die from COVID, or survive so that he could re-run for the presidency in 2024?  Or enjoying retirement after working so hard serving the country for nearly four years?

I think that any other member of government that also contracts COVID should also resign so they can recover speedily.  And also to prevent other members of government from catching the disease and dying, or being bed-ridden for weeks, possibly months, affecting how our country functions!

I'm not on Twitter or other social media besides Facebook, so please, tweet this message, post it on Instagram, or Snapchat, and all the other social medias:

I mean really, the guy almost never wears a mask or social distances and comes into contact with dozens of different people every day. The only parts of this that are hard to believe is that 1) Trump didn't catch it sooner 2) Melania got close enough to him to catch it (of course, entirely possible she got it from someone else or same person Trump did).  


It's VERY hard for me to believe that Trump would fake an illness so close to election day when he Knows he is losing. He loves getting out there and campaigning, it's literally one of the only things he truly enjoys as president, you think he'd willingly give that up for two weeks just before an election. And finally, despite what the general public thought, Trump thinks he killed it at that debate He was very likely looking forward to the next two, not looking for ways to get out of them.  


Remember too, that the White House didn't announce Hicks was positive, a reporter scooped it. If anything, the White House was going to try and keep this a secret.

"Democrats: if we want to consign the GOP to the electoral dustbin of history, we need to change the way we talk about abortion. Now is the absolute best time to start",10,j3uh0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j3uh0b/democrats_if_we_want_to_consign_the_gop_to_the/,2,1601674187,"I encourage everyone seeing this to read [this excellent piece](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/02/trump-suburbs-white-women-michigan-423870) from Tim Alberta about Elissa Slotkin's Michigan district. It’s a long piece, so I’ll quote the relevant part:

>When Slotkin’s speech wrapped up, I got to talking with two middle-aged women who were sitting in lawn chairs. **Rachel Babich and Karen Kudla both described themselves as longtime Republicans whose loyalty to the party owed largely to the issue of abortion.** Both are teachers—Kudla is now retired—and both are moms. Despite being offended by Trump four years ago, neither of them could bear to vote for Hillary Clinton.

>“I’ve been a single-issue Republican, a pro-life voter, for a very long time. But Trump changed my thinking in that regard,” Babich explained. **“I’ve had it with this idea that you’re only pro-life if you fight against abortion. I’ve come to see there’s a much better way to be pro-life, and that’s making sure our social programs are funded, making sure our climate crisis is dealt with, making sure DREAMers are being protected. That’s pro-life, too.”**

>Kudla jumped in. **“What about day care? What about paying good wages? What about helping women support their babies? Those are pro-life policies. And we don’t hear anything about them,”** she said. “Shame on us. Shame on us. I’m a devout Catholic; I pray the rosary every morning. I am so conflicted about all these things. But I cannot in good conscience vote to keep this man in the White House.”

>“Look,” Babich sighed, “I would love to see abortion not be practiced. But I would also love to see women supported to the point where they never have to make a choice between an abortion and a job, an abortion and living in poverty, an abortion and being left behind by society. I don’t want unborn children being killed. It’s awful. But **I can’t think of a more anti-life policy than to put a poor woman in a position where she has no options, where a pregnancy traps her into a life of poverty she can’t escape.”**

The way, by and large, that we Democrats have long talked about abortion -- as a question of pro-choice vs. pro-life -- creates two major, and connected, structural disadvantages for anyone with a D next to their name. First, it buys into the Republicans’ framing of the issue, enabling them to gin up enthusiasm with it almost at will, to the point where Democrats are often afraid to even mention it. But furthermore, it cedes *substantial* emotional ground to the GOP in the eyes of voters like these two. As has been said here and elsewhere, if you think abortion is murder then you’re almost never going to support a candidate who isn’t opposed to it.

But buying into the frame of abortion as allowing it or banning it almost *forces* those voters to go for the GOP, because they will likely suffer some degree of emotional trauma (“I’m supporting a baby-killer?!”) if they don’t. Therefore, **I propose we shift our focus** from talking about whether abortion should be legal to **why women get abortions,** and how we can **reduce the number of abortions performed,** a framing of the issue voters like the two women above can absolutely get behind.

An obvious first part of how you accomplish that is with properly funded education and contraception. These should absolutely be on any Democrat’s platform, and it is for many of them. But there is a much more salient line of advocacy, especially to pro-lifers: **many women have abortions because they simply cannot afford to support a child.** Unintended pregnancies are [**five times more common** for women living in poverty compared to those with middle or high income.](https://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2019/05/who-are-the-1-in-4-american-women-who-choose-abortion/)


The Republicans, with their constant opposition to policies like paid family and sick leave or affordable daycare and healthcare, policies that actually would help to *ease the burden* on women, and on families generally, of having a child, are in fact **indirectly encouraging women to get abortions.** We have all said or heard [variations on the theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvF1Q3UidWM) that Republicans only care about babies before they’re born, and cease giving a damn the moment they start having needs their mother can’t intravenously(?) provide.

So why aren’t we nailing them with that?? *Of course* a poor woman is going to get an abortion if she doesn’t have access to good healthcare to ensure she can stay healthy during the pregnancy, or affordable daycare for when the baby is born, or a job that barely pays enough to feed herself, let alone a whole ‘nother person. Say it again with me: **by denying support for these basic policies and services, Republicans are incentivizing women to abort their babies, because they have made it incredibly costly to have a child.**

This is how we dislodge single-issue abortion voters away from the GOP, just like those two women above are contemplating. The Republicans are happy to bludgeon away at the issue, touting their “pro-life records” as if that actually means anything, all the while having done *nothing*, outside of a few crackpot state gov’t bills, to actually reduce abortions. And in fact, they’re actively increasing them! We should hold them accountable for that!

Democrats should become the *real* “Pro-Life Party”, by supporting policies that don’t corner women into either having an abortion or becoming a parent in abysmal circumstances with the deck *already stacked against the child*. Democrats believe in policies that provide support to both mother and child, regardless of the circumstances, and that support will make **far more gains** in pursuit of reducing abortion than Republicans have ever achieved in over 40 years of blathering about it.

Now this doesn’t mean we’re all of a sudden not going to be supporting safe, legal abortion, and it is still the law of the land, after all. But if we can effectively reframe our language on abortion in this way, it could be a tremendous opportunity to finally go on offense against the Republicans over the *one issue* that has failed to move substantially in our direction over the decades. 

This is a fight Biden can start right now! [Abortion is the top issue for 46% of Trump voters.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election/) I have read piece after piece this cycle about single issue voters who are sticking with Trump only because of the abortion issue. **If Democrats can crack that support group and wedge even a few points away from the GOP, they will cease to be an electable party in this country.** It is time we take the fight to them, and fight for the supportive, practical policies that can make it easier for women to decide in favor of having a child, and in turn make our country and its citizens stronger and healthier.

And dont get me wrong it sounds great.. As a child my parents made to much for medicaid and to little to afford private insurance..so needless to say i missed dental appointmemts health checkups... But i have heard while yes universal healthcare benifits everyone, it is not immidiate i was explained like this but please correct if i was misinformed:

2021 -universal healthcare approved in lets say Feb.
-Everyone gets there policy by say april 2021
- lets say a child falls and chips break a front tooth requiring a false mold made by dentist ...lets say this happens in May..
-you call a dentist and instead of getting a appointment date you instead would be put on a waiting list ( most likely 6 to 12 months down the line) due to everyone needing and attempting to get work done .. 

This to me sounds ABSURD.. Basically i was told your put on a equvilant of a transplant list and have to wait for you or your minors name to come up.. But is this accurate example of how the healthcare system would work?? Cus if so im not 100% on board with paying my taxes on time to have a policy that isnt going to have me or a child seen in the time of need ...",10/2/2020 15:02

I came to the realization that his whole campaign this year has just been anti-democrat, his whole campaign has been about dividing America, not building it up. This is far different than the Trump of 2016.

My true switch moment happened when Joe Biden called for unity during the debate. That he wanted to work with everybody. Donald on the other hard blamed the democrats for everything, which is against every foundation i have that is America first.

I’m a Republican and I’m tired of Trump. I hate this division in our country, I want to help end it. And the only way I can do that is by trying to understand other people. Sure we may disagree on things, but that’s ok. I think it’s good we don’t all think the same. What I don’t think is good is our inability to listen. I want to listen to you. What can We do help bring these two parties closer together. We don’t have to agree on everything, but we don’t need to demonize each other either. I want to say I respect every democrat for having and opinion, and I value you as innovative human beings who we need to listen to. I’m not here to attack anyone or tell them they’re wrong, I’m here to try and repair a broken relationship and move forward.

Here's what I have for the month of September so far:

[His tax returns were released, revealing he only paid $750 in 2016](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html) 

(Published 9-27-2020)

\- This also revealed extremely shady and possibly illegal business right offs.

\- It also revealed the reason why he's under audit: a $72.9 million tax refund that he may have (and like did) fraudulently obtain for ""abandonment"" of a business he was a chairman of.

\- Also, his taxes showed that he has roughly $421 million in debt to some unknown entity. This is a huge conflict of interest and opens him up to be a national security threat.

He says ""sure I'm willing do do that, but I would say, I would say almost everything I see is from the left"", however never does condemn them.

\- [1:33:36](https://youtu.be/wW1lY5jFNcQ?t=5614) Trump says ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by, but I'll you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's gotta do something about Antifa and the left."" Which can easily be interpreted as an endorsement of the group.

\- [1:39:08](https://youtu.be/wW1lY5jFNcQ?t=5948) Trump attacks Biden and his son over his former drug problem.

\- [1:59:19](https://youtu.be/wW1lY5jFNcQ?t=7159) Chris Wallace asks ""Will you urge your supporters to stay calm, during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest, and will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified?"" Donald Trump responded by saying ""I'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully. Because that's what has to happen. I'm urging them to do it."" This is illegal.

&#x200B;

[The following day, Trump denies he knows who the Proud Boys are, and continues to not condemn them.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/01/politics/donald-trump-debate-election-2020-joe-biden/index.html)

I'm not a leftist, but I can't endorse a person that promotes divisionism, racism, someone that wants to disrupt democracy and freedom of speech in a country. This guy has been using the same populist and disgusting tactics that Chavez used to fool people and get away with it in his first term.

Yesterday I was watching the presidential debate and I felt a hard pain in my stomach while listening to this a-hole, it was like watching the same guy that brought misery to Venezuela, but on the other side of the spectrum, yet still, both being the same kind of person.

These are some of the things I noticed:

&#x200B;

* This guy wants to do the same as Chavez in the early 2000s with our supreme justice tribunal, fill it with ""loyal"" people that will defend him over the worst cases of crime and corruption.
* Calling the press as ""fake news"" and attempting against freedom of speech to invalidate any kind of criticism or allegations against his crimes, the same as Chavez did, closing the biggest TV channel in Venezuela (RCTV) just because they were pointing out all of the corruption that he was creating.
* Making a Cult out of his followers, fooling ignorant people to support him unconsciously just because the ""other ones"" are bad, saying that he loved the country so much, and telling a bunch of lies about the opposition on TV without showing any kind of proof. But his words were always enough because he was ""the president"".
* Divisionism, trying his hard each day to divide the people as reds and blues, and convince the reds that the blues don't care about them and that they should treat them as enemies  (Chavez would talk about this on national TV for 6 hours straight, every day.)
* treating protestors that opposed him and his acts as criminals and terrorists.
* Promoting homophobia and using ""god"" as a tool for planting his bigoted ideas into his follower's brains.
* Gaining the military and police support by giving them privileges so they can stand by his side.

a clear example that both extremes touch at the end.

these are just a small fraction of what he did and have in mind that this was just his early days, things have gotten 50x worse politically, socially, and obviously economically since then.

This idiot can say anything about that he will overthrow Maduro's dictatorship but those are all lies, they're both basically the same, authoritarians that don't want anything but to remain in power at any cost, and they're both backed up by Russia.

Take this guy out before it is too late. I wouldn't wish all the misery that we've lived to anyone.

So obnoxious in fact that I had to go low contact with her for the first few months following election day and had considered cutting off contact for about a year because she was constantly throwing his win in my face and seemed to deliberately pick fights around Trump and politics.

Well, about 2ish year ago her tune began to change. She said that Trump needed to stop tweeting so much and that he was just constantly sounding like an ass. Slowly but surely she actually seemed to start to dislike the man and was almost as disturbed by the things he said than I was. She eventually said that she just wasn't going to vote at all and I pointed out to her periodically through our conversations the kind of destructive things he was doing, regardless if she agreed with Biden or his policies.

Well, this morning she seemed to make a sudden turn I never expected. She said she was tired of the division that Trump was causing in the country and the hate he was constantly spouting and the only way to stop him was to vote against him. She is going to vote for Biden.

Wow. I never thought it would happen and I thought she would be grasping onto this life raft for the rest of her life until she drowned in the stupidity that Trump seems to represent and attract.

After finding out that I was actually still registered to vote in NC - where my absentee voter ballot was sent to- I went online today to attempt to register in my current state of SC so that I can actually vote.  Given my license number and social security number, the website located my DMV resident address in SC and it was correct. It then asks previous registration state (NC), and previous registration county (Mecklenburg). The next prompt is where it has lost me. 

The website lists in clear, capital red letters “DO NOT ENTER YOUR RESIDENCE ADDRESS AS YOUR MAILING ADDRESS”. What on earth would I list, if not my resident address? I don’t think I can use my parents home as mailing address, because they are in NC. I can’t move on to the next step until I list this “mailing address” that is NOT my resident address.

Jesus Christ - the debate was miserable. Trump did nothing but bully somebody trying to stay on topic. To add to that, he decided to say the election can't be trusted and that - basically - the Proud Boys should ""guard"" the polls. Fuck Trump. He deserves a major epic-scale loss on election day. And after that, prison. I want to see justice. Can you believe that in 2020, I might lose my right to healthcare, people can be jailed again for abortions, and that the right to same-sex marriage can just suddenly go back to ""not being a thing."" Memphis is my hometown. I grew up in the south. That city and that region molded a lot of who I am, for better or worse, and even I can see the terrifying tragedy of the moment. Half the country has lost it's ability to care about it's fellow citizen. Does Obamacare actually harm you? Does Roe v Wade actually harm you? If you change your perspective for five damn seconds you realize that there's nothing at stake for you. But, when it comes to ""liberals"" like me, we stand to lose the right to healthcare and are subject to exploitation and abuse by profit-driven health ""care"" companies. We stand to lose hope that people of color can actually witness empathy from a government who has killed them for centuries. We stand to go back to draconian times where women would have to hide and risk their lives so they can have one at all. We stand to lose a simple basic right that two people should be treated fairly under the rational definition of marriage. Tell me, please, what do Republicans have at stake? Zoning laws? A lop-sided, unfair court? The right… not to choose? I struggle to see love from you, Republicans, and I include my family in that. You cannot say you care and then smile as you watch what keeps me alive collapsing. You are selectively sociopathic, able to compartmentalize when love is appropriate and when it gets in the way. Churches across this country are filled with you. Seats meant for active compassion filled by cold, fear-driven hearts. I'm not a fan of guns at all, yet somehow I can talk with gun owners (because I actually believe it's more bi-partisan than the NRA wants you to know.) But, somehow the cult huffing the Trump-glue do not see me as a fellow American, and the thing I'm struggling with is that I'm beginning to feel the same way about you, those who vote Trump. This isn't a good thing and it's only going to get darker as the storm clouds of Trump descends on the festival by the river. He'll do his damndest to make sure the waters rise higher and higher, drowning all who attend, regardless of beliefs, regardless of loyalty, regardless of spirit. He is anti-love.

Trump can’t even own up to his tax records, and Biden was able to swallow his pride and set the record straight.

YSK that Trump's debate tactic has a name: Gish Gallop,20,j2rmfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j2rmfr/ysk_that_trumps_debate_tactic_has_a_name_gish/,4,1601518863,"[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish\_Gallop](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop)

The **Gish Gallop** is the [fallacious](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy) [debate](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Debate) tactic of drowning your opponent in a flood of individually-weak [arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument) in order to prevent rebuttal of the whole argument collection without great effort. The Gish Gallop is a conveyor belt-fed version of the [on the spot fallacy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/On_the_spot_fallacy), as it's unreasonable for anyone to have a well-composed answer *immediately* available to every argument present in the Gallop. The Gish Gallop is named after [creationist](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Creationist) [Duane Gish](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Duane_Gish), who often abused it.

Although it takes a trivial amount of effort on the Galloper's part to make each individual point before skipping on to the next (especially if they cite from a pre-concocted list of Gallop arguments), a refutation of the same Gallop may likely take much longer and require significantly more effort (per [the basic principle](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Entropy) that it's always easier to *make a mess* than to clean it back up again).

The tedium inherent in untangling a Gish Gallop typically allows for very little ""creative license"" or vivid [rhetoric](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rhetoric) (in deliberate contrast to the exciting point-dashing central to *the Galloping*), which in turn risks boring the audience or readers, further loosening the refuter's grip on the crowd.

This is especially true in that the Galloper need only [win *a single one* out of all his component arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/One_single_proof) in order to be able to [cast doubt on the entire refutation attempt](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/FUD). For this reason, the refuter *must* achieve a 100% success ratio (with all the yawn-inducing elaboration that goes with such precision). Thus, Gish Galloping is frequently employed (with particularly devastating results) in timed debates. The same is true for any time- or character-limited debate medium, including [Twitter](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Twitter) and newspaper editorials.

Gish Gallops are almost always performed with numerous other logical fallacies baked in. The myriad component arguments constituting the Gallop may typically intersperse *a few* perfectly uncontroversial claims — the basic validity of which are intended to lend undue credence to the Gallop at large — with a devious hodgepodge of [half-truths](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lying_by_omission), outright [lies](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lie), [red herrings](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Red_herring) and [straw men](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man) — which, if not rebutted as the fallacies they are, pile up into egregious problems for the refuter.

There may also be [escape hatches](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Escape_hatch) or [""gotcha"" arguments](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gotcha_argument) present in the Gallop, which are — like the Gish Gallop itself — specifically designed to be brief *to pose*, yet [take a long time to unravel and refute](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/One-way_hash_argument).

However, Gish Gallops aren't impossible to defeat — just tricky (not to say near-impossible for the unprepared). Upon closer inspection, many of the *allegedly stand-alone* component arguments may turn out to be [nothing but thinly-veiled repetitions or simple rephrasings of the same basic points](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/PRATT) — which only makes the list *taller*, not more correct (hence; ""proof *by verbosity*""). This essential flaw in the Gallop means that a skilled rebuttal of *one* component argument may in fact be a rebuttal to *many*.",9/30/2020 22:21

Should the Democrats pursue partitioning certain states in order to elect additional Senators?,2,j2q3xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j2q3xx/should_the_democrats_pursue_partitioning_certain/,3,1601514208,"The Democrats have structural disadvantages in the Senate, which leads to disadvantages in appointing Supreme Court Justices and other judges. In 2018, for example, Democratic Senate candidates collectively beat Republicans by a large margin, but the Republicans still gained seats in the Senate.

Democrats could work to bridge the gap by partitioning blue states. California, New York, and Massachusetts could likely each be partitioned in such a way that the states are still safe Democratic states, potentially leading to six more Democratic Senators. If DC is granted statehood as well, that could lead to eight more Democratic Senators. (I feel Puerto Rico should be offered statehood if the population agrees, but I believe it's presumptuous to assume their Senators would be Democrats.)

Partitioning efforts have been frequent in California, with the most recent proposal in 2018. New York saw proposals for partitioning Long Island as recently as 2010. Massachusetts hasn't had any serious proposals in the recent past, so that may be more of a long shot.

It's important that we make sure people are knowledgeable about and prepared for voting! 

Here's a list of things you can do to help everyone make sure their voices are heard in the upcoming elections:

1. Make sure you're registered to vote and show people how they can easily check online. Here's one way to check: [https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote/voter-registration-status](https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote/voter-registration-status)
2. Know your state's voter laws! What identification do you need, does your state accept absentee voting without excuse, etc. Know if there's any tricky rules/mishaps that can get your ballot discarded! Do you need a security envelope? Find out!!
3. SHARE your state's voter info!!! On any platform you can, with whoever you can! Make sure your community's voice is being heard. 
4. Host zoom parties to help people fill out ballots together. You can research and answer questions together, so that less mistakes are made and many questions can be answered at once!
5. Become a poll worker! There is a shortage of poll workers right now, and you could be PAID. 

The most important part of voting in this election is being prepared to vote, so let's help people prepare instead of just saying""vote vote vote"" over and over. Too many people's voices have been lost because they've shown up to elections and found out they aren't registered or because they signed in the wrong place on their ballot. YOU can help by speeding the word and getting involved, which is something you can do from home!

Long-time Republican from a family of Republicans. Grew up in NC in a well-off family. Always voted down party lines, but mostly because I was too lazy to actually look up what the candidates stood for. In 2016, voted for Trump because I felt that he could fix the economy with his business experience (I was hit particularly hard from the great recession) and because Hillary was shady as shit (mostly because of what happened with Benghazi). I figured ""hell at least he's better than her, what's the worst he could do?""

Flash forward to some time around 2018 when I was reading about Trump's connections to Russia and his actions just started to make sense. I realized that ""this guy is going to get us all killed or at best turn all of our allies against us, and that's exactly what our enemies want. Of course Russia supports him and China is silently fighting the trade war on their terms...they want him to self-destruct us!""

So, I started considering not voting for Trump again, and voicing this to my family. My wife thinks I'm crazy. She thinks he does no wrong and the bad things that happen in our country just happen and no one could have done anything better. There is always an excuse for why things aren't Trump's fault or it's ""fake news"". I honestly can't tell if she is actually batshit crazy or I am anymore. 

Watching the debate tonight, it was so refreshing hearing Biden act like a fucking normal president would. I feel like our country is already in such a worse place than it was 4 years ago, and I live in a part of the country that is pretty Red. It's such a sinking feeling in my stomach to think of Trump being re-elected. I know I can only cast my vote once and can't control what others do. Feels bad. 

Sorry for the soap box, not sure where else to write all this that won't get downvoted into oblivion.

Edit: Forgot to mention that when I talk to my wife about voting for Biden she says ""says the guy who voted for Trump"", like can I not change my mind now? Is that not allowed?

Next is Jimmy Kimmel who makes a joke about Trump. After this there’s little clips of various comedians making jokes about Trump. The noise fades to just laughter and gets progressively louder and louder. Louder, louder. Then a picture of Trump flashes on the screen followed by a voice that says “Trump: The Laughing Stock of America. For four years, Trump has been a joke, now it’s time for a real president.

A Suggestion To The Biden Campaign Managers (And to anyone raising money and text banking),0,j2eoox,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j2eoox/a_suggestion_to_the_biden_campaign_managers_and/,1,1601466004,"""Hey it's Kamala.  Doesn't Joe remind you of what a president should be like on the debate stage?  Joe's on stage with Trump right now, and we have to show him our support.  We set a goal to raise $5.2M from texts like these before Wednesday, and we're relying on supporters like you to help make it happen.  Will you chip in $12 now?""

Why would you send out a text that containing lies (Joe did not perform particularly presidentially, and saying that Kamala sent the text is just silly) and then ask me for money?  Do you really expect a text like that to do anything but annoy people?  

I gave you money before because I believe that Democrats fight for the facts and fight to give the most people better lives.  I'm guessing that's true of many other Democrats.  How can your campaign more effectively embody that to both raise support and raise the money you clearly so urgently want?

By providing value.  

How?

Use the numbers that you have collected to provide your supporters with facts to counteract the lies being told on-stage.  That certainly doesn't mean sending a text every minute, but rather calling out the boldest of Trumps lies and providing us with sources that prove it.  Preferably ones that are as unbiased as possible and not just news articles or words from Biden's website.

By doing this, you demonstrate your belief in truth and provide supporters with effective resources to point others to and reduce the spread of false information.  In addition, I might start thinking ""Wow, they're really putting my money to good use!  Maybe I should donate more and help them.""

To anyone who reads this, please point out any flaws in the idea.  It is totally possible that I'm just ignorant of how campaigns and text banking works or not thinking things through fully.  

If you like the idea, let's work together to find out how to improve campaign activities so we can win this goddamn election.",9/30/2020 7:40
I stuck with who to vote for.,3,j2eiwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j2eiwi/i_stuck_with_who_to_vote_for/,12,1601465395,"I believe in capitalism, low taxes and focus on managing the budget, and I believe that we need law enforcement to stop the riots and to have someone from outside the police department to do investigations involving their officers. I 100% disagree with defunding or bringing a social worker with a official to a shots fired call. I believe the officers need to be more transparent with their rules of deadly force as what I learned from criminal justice involving deadly force gave me a completely different view of how these bad innocent situations happen. 

I also believe in lgbt rights as I’m gay. I don’t care if your homophobic that’s your life but it should not prevent me from living mines.

I believe Americans have to right to buy a weapon as gun violence is increasing we need to protect ourselves. Background check need to be a must. We need to fund officers to do their job as some police departments don’t have enough funding to protect their community to stop these wrongful gun owners.

My inspiration is Robert Kennedy as he was like me who wanted to end division as he said:

 “We can move in that direction as a country, in greater polarization - black people amongst blacks, and white amongst whites, filled with hatred toward one another. Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand and to comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand, compassion and love.... What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.”

The best one I can find is rideshare2vote.com but the closest state they are active in is West Virginia.

Otherwise I think I might just take the 4-5 hour drive to West VA the night before Nov 3rd to help there.

At the time, it felt like we were fighting tooth and nail for the dignity of our country and our quality of life/rights. When the results came in in 2016,
I was an emotional wreck for a while. Obviously many of my fears came true, and my life has gone from wonderful and fulfilling to an isolated nightmare. Now it feels like we’re fighting for the same things as in 2016- except the stakes are even higher and even more lives are on the line.

So I want to ask of “older democrats”- does it ever get better? Is every presidential election such a desperate and exhausting fight to protect each other? Or is Trump an exception. Bearing the emotional weight of an election of this calibre of importance every four years is something that feels impossible.

Help an Aussie to Understand,0,j1t54d,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j1t54d/help_an_aussie_to_understand/,12,1601386032,"Hey all, Aussie with a thought/questions and looking for some feedback. Before I begin I want to be clear this will be post both here and over at r/Republican assuming moderators from both sides are comfortable with the introspection.

So, whenever one of your political leaders is shown to have done something even their peers find reprehensible (Trump's Ukraine call, Hillary's private email server), the immediate reaction is a whataboutism attacking either the other leader or even just a dubious individual or group from across the aisle. This essentially confirms the disapproval of the favoured leader's actions, otherwise the actions would be plainly defensible outright, no?

This just seems so dopey yet 9/10 its the go-to response, and I know there are smart cookies on both sides. We don't do this to the same degree over here and if anything the party leader is crowned king dipstick and most open to criticism. Your candidates just seem to have ethical rap sheets that could circumnavigate the globe, with any item seeming ripe for disqualification. Both parties have had respectable leaders in the past and most people know somebody in their personal lives they respect - so this is possible. My thinking is that if dems/republicans were more critical of their leaders they might actually build an environment for worthwhile candidates to rise, which might then lead to candidates more palatable to voters across the political spectrum? If ever I had the chance to vote for a respectable candidate of any political leaning that wasn't dripping slime I'd jump at it. Seems like a cut the nose off to spite the face approach to me, or at least spite the other team.

So truly, what's going on here? At first I'd guess it's a compassionate understanding that we all make mistakes, but when it only really applies to one's team captain I'm left stumped.

*Disclaimer: Because it is sure to matter, most of our Aussie politicians from the major parties are spineless centrists so I am not heavily invested in either team. Regardless of the current candidates I don't believe my aligned values of integrity, fortitude and equality are the exclusive property of either US party.*",9/29/2020 9:27

Here's an issue that should unite liberals and the left: Trump's fascistic tactics in Portland. Why aren't we talking about this more?,5,j12duh,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j12duh/heres_an_issue_that_should_unite_liberals_and_the/,2,1601282918,"Many of you already know about this, but for those who don't. Take a look at this timeline of the protests in Portland: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Portland,_Oregon

**June**

* Mostly peaceful, few stories of mild civil unrest
* No request for federal assistance from Mayor Wheeler or Governor Brown
* No constitutional authority for Trump to intervene

**Late June**

Trump issues an executive order to protect statues. Because of course he fucking did. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_deployment_of_federal_forces_in_the_United_States#Founding_of_PACT

This gives him the constitutional excuse he needs to not only assemble a task force of federal agents, but to enter cities where the precious statues might be endangered.

**July**

After the feds get involved, it's just story after story of riots and violence.

**August**

Feds finally pull out, and it immediately gets more peaceful. Not as peaceful as June, unsurprisingly. 

The fucking priorities of this man. In the middle of a pandemic, he issues an executive order to protect statues in order to give himself an excuse to send the federal government into a city against the wishes of the mayor and state governor. He places them directly in the path of the protests, deliberately encouraging conflicts between protesters and the feds. A few kidnappings into unmarked vans later, Trump decided he's collected enough video clips for FOX News and withdraws. Things immediately settle down.

Trump doesn't give a fuck about those statues, but he knows the mouthbreathing conservative culture warriors do. How fucking blatant is that? Everyone on the left and in the center should be outraged by this. Everyone on the right, fuck you.

**edit:**

I think my original post was maybe too focused on the timeline in Oregon, which is important to the story, but not quite as alarming as the executive order protecting statues which is really what makes this whole thing fascist.

Executive Order 13933, Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating Recent Criminal Violence, **has been interpreted as allowing federal officers to be deployed without the permission of individual U.S. states.** It's also been used to authorize domestic surveillance.

I don't know how anybody could read about this and not be alarmed. This is without precedent. Don't take it from me, though. [Take it from FOX News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/judge-napolitano-operation-legend-federal-troops-chicago):

>“If the state officials or local officials consent to the introduction of federal assets on the streets and for law enforcement purposes there is no constitutional impediment,” [Judge Napolitano] explained. “But if they don't consent, then there is a constitutional impediment.”

I know we haven't always gotten along, progressives, leftists, liberals, centrists, libertarians, and so on. But please take a long hard look at the base principles of whichever ideology you favor.

I think the vast majority of people who hold those principles should be able to agree on this one thing. Right wingers, you're going to regret this path. Abandon your shit ideology and join the rest of the free world already.

**edit 2:**

The more I think about this, the worse it gets. What that executive order achieves:

1. There is no federal law prohibiting damage to state monuments and statues. There are state laws, but there's no federal law.

2. So the executive order creates a new type of ""forbidden"" behavior that was not forbidden before. Again, it's not a law or a crime at the federal level.

3. It authorizes the creation of a massive federal paramilitary force in order to enforce this new federal prohibition against the forbidden behavior.

4. The force can be deployed into states and cities even against the consent of the state and city government.

5. Destroying statues on state property is already a crime in every state, does that make this less bad? Yes. In a more charitable view, you could say that this is just the federal government enforcing the law on behalf of the state when the state itself refuses to do. Never mind that many cities were actually okay with the statues being destroyed and in many cases even announced that they would take them down themselves.

This will definitely be challenged in the courts, so it may yet be ruled unconstitutional. By the new 6-3 Supreme Court. If they find it constitutional, here's one potential way to state the precedent: ""An executive order can prohibit a behavior and enforce this under threat of violence, even against the will of state and local governments, so long as the prohibited behavior is already illegal in that state.""

This isn't good. One of tactics that city governments use to deal with protests and riots is to basically stop enforcing some petty crimes. Graffiti and minor vandalism particularly, or allowing statues to be destroyed which in many cities actually did a pretty damn good job of calming everyone down.

Now Trump can legally escalate any protest to violence in any American city. No meaningful protest can avoid producing some amount of graffiti, littering, vandalism, noise level laws. He can use it selectively too: aggressive and heavy handed federal involvement at BLM protests, no federal involvement at Proud Boys protests. ""Everyone has been calling these guys 'fascists' but at least they can protest peacefully, unlike the other side.""

This isn't a good path to be heading down. We've seen this before.",9/28/2020 4:48
Fox News and Trump supporters have already decided the New York Times report on Trump's taxes is fake news. Got me thinking....,6,j12d34,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j12d34/fox_news_and_trump_supporters_have_already/,7,1601282832,"A big problem with a lot of remaining Trump supporters is that they're happy enough with their individual lives that they don't see the need for candidates that promote change.

The things that upset them most in their day to day lives are the ""bad"" things they hear about that other people are doing. So they're going to vote for the person they think will stop the ""bad things"".

They are also heavily group focused and do not want to have an opinion that is different from their people. They trust their people and that someone has done the research even if they ""don't have time for that"".

If you had been a part of thier group and you disagree, it's assumed that you're changing groups and becoming brainwashed so your points will be dismissed.

So how do we actually win them over?

I think we have to make them think we're not too different from them whenever possible. And speak only to the things that affect them directly or morally infuriate them.

If they're a one policy voter with abortion- talk to them about how you used to be ""pro life"" too until you read about it and learned that more people are supported in their and their babies lives through the pro choice movement.

If they are worried about their taxes going up and the government being too big, talk about how Trump has not helped in those departments and how Biden's tax plan is actually more favorable for them.

They don't care about our causes. We have to convince them on grounds that matter to them.

Alternative to Court Packing,5,j0shwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j0shwh/alternative_to_court_packing/,4,1601247578,"1. Eliminate a set number of Justices.\*
2. Have a president nominate a new justice in the first and third year of their term.
3. Establish implied consent from the Senate after six months.
4. Set a term limit of twenty years from when this law is established.
5. Set some minimum qualification requirements for Judges and Justices; Such as rated qualified by the American Bar Association.

It would eliminate the uncertainty of how many justices get nominated by a single president. It would make the court less 'swingy' and more steady. This is a less partisan method of improving the court in the long term. It does not set a precedent of just increasing the number of justices every presidency and does not further entrench the court as a partisan institution.

So what do you guys think?

Which close Senate races should we donate to?,7,izeue6,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/izeue6/which_close_senate_races_should_we_donate_to/,5,1601045760,"Just thought I'd try to get a better feel from you guys on where my donation(s) might be most effective right now.  I'm going by the rule of thumb that it's more effective to give directly to the candidates themselves than say, the DNC for them to use however. I tried to generically search for advise that might give a little bit more of bird's eye view over all the races, but came up short. So if you had say, $100, (I intend to give more, ) how would you spread it strategically over the tighest or most vital races? Of course every race is important, but maybe you have insights or resources into who actually needs the money more right now?

I've used Actblue for Biden a few times, and given a little to Amy McGrath, but recently heard that she may not be able to overtake McConnell, and the money could be better used elsewhere? I also heard that Harrison running against Lindsey actually has plenty of money, and the polls are still tight AF. So I'm just skeptical.

Setup a stand on campus to get people to register?,7,izdzpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/izdzpg/setup_a_stand_on_campus_to_get_people_to_register/,5,1601041454,"Hi everyone!
So I just had a sudden idea and wanted to see if anyone has any suggestions or experience with something like this.

I’m currently enrolled in a community college in rural Kansas. Campus is pretty dead but ppl still are still on campus for class, so I had this idea of setting up a table and setting up a couple laptops that people can stop by to quickly register to vote (our deadline to register is October 13). Hold up a couple signs to call people over and let them know what we’re there for and yeah. 


The thing is that I’m not very involved with my campus or any organizations. I’m assuming I would have to ask some official from the school to be able to do this. I’m not a very social person, in fact I’m pretty shy but I feel very strongly in sticking it to Trump supporters here in this town and getting people to register. Especially since I know that if a lot of us younger people get together we might bare substantial weight in this election.

Any opinions, suggestions? Is this even reasonable or should i leave it alone and let someone else better versed take care of it? How would my school take it if I asked them? 

I was thinking this doesn’t have to be a big deal, but maybe I’m wrong and there’s a lot more to it? After all, I don’t really see any political groups in my town trying to get people to register or anything so maybe there’s a reason for that.",9/25/2020 9:44

So I’m a Hispanic-American living in Puerto Rico. As of now I am grimly witnessing what was the slow descent of what was left of American Democracy turn into a full blown high-speed train headed to fascism and I can do absolutely diddly squat about it because I don’t have a say when it comes to the presidential election. I can vote for exactly zero senators, and can only vote for a single-non-voting representative in the House (she can only vote in assigned committees). On the other hand, the outcome of the whole election will directly impact what happens over here, negatively or positively. We are 3.1 million Americans in a state of limbo where we are not our own country and therefore cannot trade with other countries, but we also can’t participate in any meaningful way in the laws that Congress approves over us or over the nation as a whole. 


I wanted to ask y’all directly. What are your thoughts on admitting Puerto Rico as a state? 

Before you answer here are some facts:

1. Puerto Rico is about the size of Iowa. It would have 6 electoral votes. 

2. I can see Puerto Rico as a lean D state, having 1-2 Dem Senators and 2-3 Dem representatives, depending on the election year. 

3. Essentially, we lean Democrat, but we could easily go Republican if it’s a wave year and with the right messaging. Similarly to a smaller Michigan or Pennsylvania.",9/25/2020 6:03

DEEP STATE?,1,iz49ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iz49ly/deep_state/,1,1601005448,"So, I have a question. If Democrats are all part of a ""deep state"" conspiracy, is it the lamest of all overthrows of any government anywhere? Everything the Democrats have done since trump has been in office has been a colossal failure. How can you take over a government with all the following rules and working within the boundaries of the law. 
I mean if you are going to overthrow a government you would need a charismatic leader that could make people believe whatever he wants, you would want to devide the nation and make your followers feel as if there very life is at stake and the other half of the nation wants to subjugate every aspect of there lives. You want to get leaders of your party to fall lock step in behind you. Skirt the law, convince your followers that you are exactly like they are even though it should be obvious that he is nothing like you. Start saying that everything the other party does is in antithesis of what you belive and you need to defend it to save the world. Start saying that if the other party wins it can only be because they cheated and lied. Then you, yourself lie, lie, lie never admit fault or weakness. If some disagrees with you or your agenda start blowing the dog whistles and destroy them. Push, push,push don't stop never pass up an opportunity to denigrate and sow seeds of doubt and discontent. Change the rules to meet your needs. Make small changes that no one would suspect anything until all the rules have been change to benefit you. And finally get help from an enemy state. 
Democrats haven't done any of these things, so I guess we need to get on the ball before the Republicans do....this.....shit!",9/24/2020 23:44

So I’ve been following the press titles regarding the Supreme Court judges and Trump. I didn’t really understand it really. Tried to read some articles but none of them is “non-US-citizen- friendly”. Can someone explains what happened exactly, and how is that affecting the elections? The reason why I’m asking is that I’m in the final episodes of House of Cards S05 (not gonna see S06) and there are lots of similarities between the psychopaths that are Trump and Francis underwood. 

Their manipulative, anti-social (in the psychological context) personality made it hard for me to ignore the fact the House of Cards is actually predicting what’s gonna happen in the near future.

This race has never been closer and we have a real fighting chance but we can't do it without help. In the age of COVID, voting has never been safer or easier but many of our neighbors don't know how to vote. We will be calling Kentuckians every day from now until the election on November 3rd to inform them on how to vote and to tell them what Amy stands for, Amy is counting on us. Making phone calls and having one on one conversations is the most effective way of securing someone's vote and support.

I watched American citizens and reporters get beaten and gassed illegally. I watched it be done by local police, military, and federal forces. I got pissed off. I started protesting for the first time. Accidentally started a veteran organization. 3 months later we're growing and the need is bigger than ever. My eyes have been opened and I can't unsee the travesty occurring in our country right now. Now we need your help. [Volunteer here.](https://www.continuetoserve.vet/get-involved) [Our website here.](https://www.continuetoserve.vet)

&#x200B;

On June 1st, I watched something I had never personally witnessed. I watched people, citizens, reporters, journalists, photographers, peacefully protesting or doing their jobs reporting the news, be beaten, gassed, and shot with rubber bullets. I had blackhawks hovering over my house and a city I have come to love and call home was flooded with thousands of federal officers and military personnel. It was a small taste of what martial law would be like. And as a combat veteran, as someone who has lost people overseas in what I now believe were useless and unnecessary wars, I did not sign up, deploy, and lose friends, my mental health, my own family upon my return, so that I could watch a President utterly destroy the very fabric our nation was founded on.

On June 2nd, myself and a fellow veteran I deployed with went to BLM Plaza to stand in solidarity with the BLM movement and for the rights of all Americans to protest and exercise their 1A right to free speech. We stood because we believed that the military should never be used on US soil to silence a free people with rights. This is not the America I grew up believing in. So we stood. 

Having never organized before, having never gone to a protest, I had no idea what to do or what to expect. We've now been out there for 3 months. Standing with, supporting local BLM grassroots orgs, and now we are on the brink of establishing our own 501c3 to continue our mission. We are Continue To Serve, a veteran-based nonprofit, focused on social justice issues and community service. We stand for the rights of all citizens and intend to remember our oath to support and defend the Constitution and the citizens it represents. 

I'm not asking for donations. I am asking for something more valuable, we need your time, your energy, your expertise. Veterans, please join us in standing up for what is right and calling out what is wrong. We are a direct action organization, but in time, we are planning on establishing training and education platforms, community service support systems, and we will expand into more than just the BLM Movement and the Vote. There are many issues that need our attention and veterans can no longer sit idle and stay quiet. We must stand. Please join us. No matter where in the country you are, we can use your help.

**WHO TO NOT DONATE TO**

Amy McGrath of Kentucky 
I loath Mitch McConnell, but if polls are any indication, McGrath can not win, it is not worth it to spend money on this race, it's sad, but the next best thing to replacing McConnell is making him lose control of the senate 

Doug Jones of Alabama 
It pains me to say this, but Jones is losing, there's not anything that can be done about it. Alabama is red as hell and it's just a waste of money. I love Jones and wouldn't trade his last three years representing Alabama for anything, but it was always borrowed time. (I'm hoping he gets picked for Attorney General)

John Hickenlooper of Colorado 
Full stop, Gardner is done, Hickenlooper will win in Colorado no matter what, which is good because it's more money to other senate races

Mark Kelly of Arizona 
Mark Kell is up against McSally, BY DOUBLE DIGITS. Kelly has all the money he needs, this seat is another safe Dem pickup 

**WHO TO SEND MONEY TOO**
Sara Gideon of Maine https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ads-sg-feb?refcode=ads-190701-gs-evergreen_dtd-natl-searchers_brandedkeys-ad1-sara gideon&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2aa_79Sceea4kEwu7sN_8oTI5z4BaMeIKalj1NqFzR33fGDxv6DVWQaAljmEALw_wcB

Cal is in a single digit race against Tillis in what is most likely the tipping point of the senate, we win this, we have the senate thanks to Harris

Gary Peters of Michigan https://secure.actblue.com/donate/peters_ads?refcode=ads_gs_branded_d2d_nat&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtZH7BRDzARIsAGjbK2avY2rR9NSEDaD5kqyZxoP37ckSnnH0PKjQRNXgTMrmSUIzcQAN65AaAogqEALw_wcB

Guess what? Both of Georgia's senate seats are up and the best dem to flip this one is Warnock, who has overtaken Liberman in polls for the top dem in this race. Please donate and pray we don't get locked out of this race.

**WHO TO MAYBE GIVE MONEY TO**

Dr. Al Gross of Alaska

Alaska may be red but it's also very independent and that's who Gross is, and independent with the backing of the democratic party. Polls shows a race with many undecideds but ultimately this is a long shot. If you want to, give the good Doctor some moeny

Dr. Barbara Bollier of Kansas https://bollierforkansas.com
Another doctor and another long shot. While Kobach is unfortunately not her opponent, polls still show a close race. I wish we had more but until then she's not a bad investment 

Mike Espy of Mississippi https://espyforsenate.com
Another long shot but a possible pickup if we're lucky. He came close in the special election in 2018 so here's to hoping he wins.

MJ Hegar of Texas https://mjfortexas.com
Texas is trending blue, and while Cornyn is not as disliked as Cruz, he is also not as well known. Polls aren't the best but there's a possibility here. Fingers crossed 

That's it for now. All other seats are safe for both democrats and republicans. Please give what you can and even volunteer

The past two rep presidents didn’t win the popular vote. George bush won when Florida (run by his brother Jeb) said they miscounted the votes and it was too close to call. Then W (from an oil family) sent America to war with a country based on the lie that they had weapons of mass destrucion. Iraq never did.  They had oil which we annexed and they had death for thousands of Americans. Bush lied. Got what he wanted and thousands died. 

Donald also didn’t win the popular vote. He won when Russia interfered in the election and got him the win. This, in addition to years of gerrymandering districts to benefit republican outcomes and making it virtually impossible for low income citizens to vote in republican urban areas got him the win. Now he has assigned one of his largest financial donors to run the post office to manage mail in ballots. For the epidemic, Donald  admitted he lied to the American people that it was not so bad. He lied and hundreds of Thousands more Americans died. 

The republican head of the senate blocked the assignment of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee for a whole year saying it was too close to an election to vote. And now with less than two months to an election he is trying to force one in. Cheating. They make third grader excuses and say everyone does it and keep doing it. They ignore congressional subpoenas because they know they would be convicted. They suppress and attack scientific facts because they know their extremist beliefs are wrong. Cheating. 
The Republican Party can not win anything on a fair playing field so they cheat. Consistently. Year after year so they can get what they want at the expense of the rest of the country.

Hope in the midst of darkness,10,ixd4f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ixd4f5/hope_in_the_midst_of_darkness/,4,1600764004,"Fellow Democrats,

Be brave!

We are facing the greatest challenge since World War II, we stand in the midst of darkness. The pandemic is taking countless lives due to the greatest dereliction of duty by a President in the history of America and those who follow him. The economic consequences will be felt for years to come as will the grief for every American lost. There will be a need to care for those who will have suffered permanent damage to their lungs and hearts. Not to mention the psychological trauma this period will have caused on thousands of Americans. Children all across America will need all the support we can give them to get them back on track in school, young adults will need support to get their careers back on track. All this as we must, absolutely must, tackle the crisis of global warming head on.

Be full of Hope!

I am full of hope, even as we stand in the midst of darkness, while the Republicans are clawing their hooks into the Supreme Court, and the pandemic rages on, I am full of hope. 

I am hopefull because people all across America have had it. They've had it with draconian Republican policies that no longer are tolerable. The republican party has been leaning on anti abortion, anti health care, anti financial aid, anti LGBTG  rights, anti climate and anti truth for too long and people have had it. People have had it with republican cronyism and self dealing. People have had it with the President and the Senate who serve themselves and wall street over the stakeholders of this nation.

Work arduously!

We are ahead in crucial senate races, in particular in Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado. When we win those races we take the senate. Recent polling shows we are competitive in Alaska, Montana, Kansas, Texas, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina. Let's us get right on it because America deserves better, America wants better.

This is the election were we beat back the darkness, this is the election were we retake the senate, the presidency and keep the house and get this nation back on track. 

Sleep sound at night knowing that there is hope in the midst of darkness and wake to work for the change America needs.",9/22/2020 4:40
Democrat Agenda for first 100 days,13,ixcyt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ixcyt1/democrat_agenda_for_first_100_days/,10,1600763420,"There is no doubt that the Republicans have been re-writing rules to allow them to maintain their minority rule (evidence in stacking federal judges after refusing hearings with Obama, stealing the Garland seat and then reversing with RBG). Here are my thoughts on what the democrat administration needs to do to restore democracy. This assumes Biden wins and we take back at least 50 seats in the Senate.

1. Get rid of the filibuster. Republicans aren't interested in norms or rules and the dems should stop playing by the old rules. In order to restore order to the republic with reform, this rule needs to go.
2. Term limits on Supreme Court judges. I know a lot of folks talk about packing the court, but the challenge is the death spiral this creates. When republicans get power back they'd just do the same, so we'd go from 9 to 11 to 13 and so on. Term limits could accomplish the same goal. If set at 16 years, effective immediately, it would boot Thomas, Robert and Altito- along with Breyer. This would give the dems a 5-4 advantage in the first term. 
3. Statehood for DC and consider splitting California into two states. Red states have way too much power overall, relative to population. The only way to level this playing field is to add to the field. By adding 2 - 4 safe democratic seats, the senate will be more reflective of the US population.
4. Get rid of the electoral college. Small population center states votes count more than dense states. The electoral college is the only reason republicans have won in the recent past. Every vote should be equal in the presidential election.
5. New voter rights laws, including federal rules restricting Gerrymandering. Clearly the dems need to restore voter rights that the Supreme Court knocked down. But, in addition, we have to stop the blatant gerrymandering. I'm not sure the answer, but the crazy shapes to ensure a democrat or republican victory have to go. Gerrymandering allows for more 'safe' districts where a party can run an extreme candidate and win. This encourages more and more extreme candidates that aren't beholden to the people because they can't be voted out. Get rid of this and we can reduce extreme politics (and maybe, just maybe the parties will start working together occasionally).
6. New laws on the media to make them accountable for their reporting. Opinion shows rule the cable news network and Fox has no journalist integrity. Hannity will report on conspiracy theories like they are fact and then does not retract when they are proven false. There has to be penalties for spreading false information without equal time retracting the information (on the same show). This should extent to FB, BTW.

&#x200B;

Once you have all of this done, the democrats need to move fast on health care, tax reform and corruption laws. But without the above done, we'll be hanging from fingertips every 2-4 years.  Government needs to work for the people, not the few, special interests and the rich. Biden and team will need to have some courage to pass all of these suggestions and, if they do, the country could become sane again.",9/22/2020 4:30

Are Trump campaign fundraising emails and texts illegal?,0,ix0tbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ix0tbf/are_trump_campaign_fundraising_emails_and_texts/,4,1600725118,"**TL:DR**

My understanding is that fundraising practices for political campaigns are pretty heavily regulated. So my question is: is the Trump campaign using illegal practices, and if so, why is no one taking it to court?

**Details**

I thought it would be interesting to sign up for Trump emails and texts. Interesting it was, but also kinda scary. And more specifically, full of lies and deception. Beyond being angry about this (somehow it really boiled my blood that he's taking advantage of his own supporters), it really seems like it should be illegal to lie in your campaign fundraising. I'm especially interested in verifying these ""700% match"" claims. Here are a few specific example snippets (with real name redacted):

Texts:

“2016, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.” 

2018, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait to the next election.”

2016, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): “I don’t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term - I would say that if it was a Republican president.”

2016, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): “The very balance of our nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.”

2016, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice.” 

2016, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): “The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.”

2016, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): “In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.” 

2016, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): “The Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.”

2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.”

2016, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): “I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.”

2016, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): “I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.””",9/21/2020 13:43

"Could a Democratic House and Senate (with some help) impeach and convict Trump between Jan 3 and Jan 20, 2021?",0,iwx6eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/iwx6eq/could_a_democratic_house_and_senate_with_some/,8,1600709523,"I don't think this is a likely scenario. But is it possible? Nothing about the next few months is going to be typical, all kinds of shenanigans may happen. Many Democrats in power appear to have realized that restricting their strategies to any honored conventions other than the actual law and Constitution puts them at disadvantage to aggressive Republican tactics.

Winners of the November 2020 election will be sworn in on these dates:

New senators are sworn in Jan 3, 2021.

Source: [Wikipedia - 2020 US Senate elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_Senate_elections)

New representatives sessions also start Jan 3.

Source: [Wikipedia - US House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives)

BUT, any new president would not be inaugurated, until January 20, 2021.

Source: [Wikipedia - US Presidential Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election)

ERGO: From January 3, 2021 until January 20, 2021, there would be a window of time where a Democratic majority in the House and Senate could both impeach President Trump - even if Trump was a lame duck president.

Granted a Senate conviction even with a Democratic majority would be difficult, given the need for 2/3 votes to convict. But as the majority, Democrats would have new power to highlight Trump's impeached behavior and pressure or persuade Republican's to help.

Last note: If Trump were convicted in January by the Senate, but had won the election, his ability to take up office on January 20, 2021 would still depend on a separate vote by the Senate on whether to prevent him from ever being able to hold office again. That would seem certain after a conviction given a Democratic majority and this quote from the source below:

A Dem-leaning billionaire/highly-funded organization makes a proposal: If you are a Democrat-leaning person living in a urban state interested in securing more blue seats in the Senate this organization will subsidize to some degree your relocation to Wyoming, a very red state with a 2020 population of 578K people

Some issues I expect with this are:

* finding enough liberals willing and able to move from a blue state to Wyoming
* the cost involved in subsidizing the massive migration

Suppose these were not problems. Would this work?

Dad says he’s lost faith in how Trump and the Republicans are managing the pandemic and they’re not helping out the little guy. When I asked him if he’s still voting for Trump, I got radio silence. For comparison, my mom had to plead with him to quit talking politics at Thanksgiving. 

Dad also just got laid off from his lucrative blue collar job. He’s always been a midwestern labor guy but became very skeptical about the Mexicans coming to take his job, which was the impetus for his voting for Trump. Now that he’s without one, it seems he’s returning to his union roots.

Why free college?,5,n17ef5,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/n17ef5/why_free_college/,22,1619740434.0,"Many in the democratic party think a free college education is a good idea because a high school diploma doesn't prepare one for our modern economy.  While I fully agree that college can be beneficial for many people, I also know people who wasted their time and money on a degree they don't use. 

My question is, why free college instead of improving high school education? 

Wouldn't that be a more efficient use of resources and, probably, an easier policy to get passed? Bringing trade classes (i.e. machine shop, carpentry, cooking) would provide useful skills and people wouldn't have to go to those scam for-profit school.",2021-04-29 19:53:54

I continue with why he was ""hired"" (elected)  for the term, when if someone was hiring a janitor,  they would check their experience  to see if a broom fit in their hand! But Norco, the ""followers"" are tired of career politicians,  so let's go with someone with a resume of bankruptcy,  marital affairs, lawsuits, and a daddy who payed his way.

They then feel the need to say something about our President,  like, he is going to ban red meat! I ask them where they heard that , and here comes Fox news.  They will throw back he is tearing down the fence, letting all the rapists and murderers in. Then I correct what they are claiming.

If they are going to bitch about our President, at least have a reason. Don't  just dislike him because he isn't  the other guy. Know your facts before you gripe, and be prepare to explain them.

Of course that is just good old common sense, and asking for that in today's  world, is ridiculous.

Some quick background. In a 2008 case called District of Columbia v. Heller, the court’s “originalist” conservatives took the text of the Second Amendment and essentially crossed out everything up to and including “free State,” ruling for the first time that the right to bear arms has nothing to do with well-regulated militias

The 1934 Mid-Term Elections And Why They Are Relevant,10,n05l2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/n05l2u/the_1934_midterm_elections_and_why_they_are/,2,1619608267.0,"The ""common wisdom"" is that the President's party loses seats in the mid-terms. I think this claim is obsolete in the Trump Era. I predict that President Biden's party will gain seats because of his popularity.

Of course, if you are a Democrat, you already know that Franklin Roosevelt was elected in 1932 and took office in 1933. So you already know that the 1934 mid-terms was a referendum on FDR's first 100 days and first year in office. What you probably don't know is the results.

 From Wiki:

The Democrats built on the Congressional majorities they had won in the previous two elections. In the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives), Roosevelt's party gained nine seats, mostly from the [Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)). The Democrats also gained nine seats in the [U.S. Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate), thereby winning a supermajority. A [Progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Progressive_Party) also unseated a Republican in the Senate. This marked the first time since the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) that an incumbent president's party gained seats in a midterm election, followed by [1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_1998) and [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_2002).

The election was perhaps the most successful midterm of the 20th century for the party in control of the presidency.

That being said, I also respect the Senate's role as a deliberative body and as a check on the more unhinged populism of the House of Representatives.

I'm concerned about the GOP using a simple majority next time they're in power to do some really destructive things.  Thus I'm not certain that nuking the filibuster outright would be the best approach.  However, even if we were to bend the rules to allow the bill's passage, I still believe that GOP would use this as justification to circumvent the filibuster anyway, since they're in general way more vindictive and dishonest/shameless than Democrats.

What is the strategy, if any, right now within the Senate majority caucus?  I have called both of my Senators to tell them how important I believe SB1 to be, but where we go from here seems strategically treacherous.",2021-04-26 16:55:15

Repeal the Gay Blood Ban,20,my15pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/my15pf/repeal_the_gay_blood_ban/,1,1619355186.0,"The Gay Blood Ban is now technically only a 3-month, and until recently 12-month, ""deferral"" (though conservative elements at the FDA and Red Cross fought that one tooth and nail...  Not surprising: in my own personal experience training/volunteering with them in the Midwest, the Red Cross is still full of homophobes in many parts of the country...) but is still effectively a ban on any sexually-active gay man, or bisexual man currently in a same-sex relationship, from giving blood.

This article discusses it:

https://georgetownvoice.com/2021/04/17/gay-men-cant-donate-blood/

This ban, because that's what it really is, needs to stop.  It must end.

As hospitals cried out desperately for blood during the height of this pandemic, it was extremely discouraging knowing, for instance, that as I tried to drag my homophobic father by the ear to give blood with me, I (a only partly out-of-closet bisexual: my father doesn't know) could face some very awkward conversations with a homophobic Red Cross nurse that might risk alerting my nosy father, if I tried to give...  (as it happens I hadn't had any sexual contact with ANYONE in the 3 months before that, and my last sexual relationship had been with a woman anyways: in fact I've been largely abstinent my entire life both due to my own religious reasons/concerns with too much premarital or homosexual sex, and due to having incredible difficulty being accepted in dating...)

This ban coats lives.  It discourages people from giving when there is absolutely no reason for it.  In fact, that liason with a woman I hadn't known long (from internet dating, and SHE was the one who got things sexual by the way) and could have carried any of numerous STD's (condoms were used, but can break or slip...) was inarguably a LOT riskier than a homosexual married couple who had been in an exclusive relationship 20 years would be...

The fact I could've donated the day after screwing a random girl from Tinder who I barely knew, if I wanted, but a committed homosexusl couple would be barred from donating blood for 3 ENTIRE MONTHS after having sex (which, let's face it, no real couple is going to go that long without... so it's effectively a ban) is absolutely incorrigible.

Biden is in office.  Moderate Democrats CLAIM to want to save lives in this pandemic- and the next one.

And a blood shortage costs lives every day (I would know: I'm a biologist and a pre-med, taking my 2nd and 3rd Master's at a Med School- I have shadowed doctors, worked EMS, and have a LOT of academic and incidental exposure to the medical system).  So why don't we get this fixed?",2021-04-25 08:53:06

A message long forgotten,5,mur8bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/mur8bq/a_message_long_forgotten/,3,1618956785.0,"Crucially, Socrates was not elitist in the normal sense. He didn’t believe that a narrow few should only ever vote. He did, however, insist that only those who had thought about issues rationally and deeply should be let near a vote. 

We have forgotten this distinction between an intellectual democracy and a democracy by birthright. We have given the vote to all without connecting it to that of wisdom. 

And Socrates knew exactly where that would lead: to a system the Greeks feared above all, demagoguery. dēmos ‘the people’ + agōgos ‘leading Ancient Athens had painful experience of demagogues, for example, the louche figure of Alcibiades, a rich, charismatic, smooth-talking wealthy man who eroded basic freedoms and helped to push Athens to its disastrous military adventures in Sicily. 

Socrates knew how easily people seeking election could exploit our desire for easy answers. He asked us to imagine an election debate between two candidates, one who was like a doctor and the other who was like a sweet shop owner. 

The sweet shop owner would say of his rival: *Look, this person here has worked many evils on you. He hurts you, gives you bitter potions and tells you not to eat and drink whatever you like. He’ll never serve you feasts of many and varied pleasant things like I will.*

Socrates asks us to consider the audience response: Do you think the doctor would be able to reply effectively? The true answer – ‘I cause you trouble, and go against you desires in order to help you’ would cause an uproar among the voters, don’t you think? 

We have forgotten all about Socrates’s salient warnings against democracy. We have preferred to think of democracy as an unambiguous good – rather than a process that is only ever as effective as the education system that surrounds it. **As a result, we have elected many sweet shop owners, and very few doctors**",2021-04-20 18:13:05

Anyways, do you really think the Republicans actually think the Covid relief package wasn't really covid relief? Or do you think they don't want to be seen as helping Biden push his agenda?

Recently I've been delving deep into right ideologies and as a result conspiracy theories/false information. I'm beginning to believe and have doubts about COIVD-19, the vaccine, and the current state of the government. I'm looking for the voice of reason here. I don't want to indoctrinate myself and need some fact checking, logical reasoning, and persuasion back to a realistic perspective of our country. 

Here are major points of correction: 

\- The contents of the COVID vaccine; can we trust that the vaccine is safe? Does it contain harmful substances? The government is pushing the vaccine hard, can we trust what they say or is this another case of lobbying and/or government/corporate propaganda? Are the ""jacking"" the vaccine, adding additional ingredients they aren't telling us? It comes down to this; is the vaccine safe to take?

\- Coronavirus has a >\~2% fatality rate, is it really worth it to shut down the economy? The economic impact of COVID is costing many jobs, how are people supposed to pay for rent, food, utilities? Even with stimulus from the government people are still struggling. Is this just a plot against the people?

I'm looking for facts, not a right wing eco chamber to indorenate me further. Can I trust government sentiment? In our modern world there is an influx of information and its hard to tell what's true and what's false. Please correct the misinformation that has plagued me, I need a realist view of our current government. 

\*This is not trolling. I am not looking to debate. I am looking for factually correct information that will give me a realistic view of our country.\*

I'm going to get basted for this but it's truly to illustrate the way I feel about canceling student debt...,0,mpj9rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/mpj9rp/im_going_to_get_basted_for_this_but_its_truly_to/,11,1618278728.0,"So I want to illustrate why this cancelling of student debt proposal is not the greatest idea:

\- We offer a windfall to some-18% of the population....18%.  This is not a large portion of the population

\- We are offering this to roughly 44.7M people and/or a total of $1.7T in student debt.

Lets assume that the full 100% of the estimated student debt isn't relieved but just a majority.  So we are going to add ANOTHER $1.25T to our national debt to relieve 18% of the population?  And we think this will ""save"" a lot of people and stimulate the economy?  $1.25T is pretty much what our first infrastructure package was to help THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, this helps 18%.

This needs to start by addressing the problem first.  Student loan originators and the schools themselves need to be put into check first and foremost, I want to illustrate with a personal story I had the pleasure of going through with a close friend of mine.

I wanted to help a friend of mine deal with one of these student loan entities, Navient which is one of the larger ones.  Scenario was they had to go into bankruptcy for a completely unrelated reason to student loans back in 2012.  Once he came out of the bankruptcy this loan popped back up on his radar and it was actually a loan he took out for his daughters college schooling.  He shared all the info with me and it is unbelievable the liberties Navient took upon themselves during this time.  It actually stated on the invoice/bill to them directly under the ""Interest Rate"" line item that ""Interest rates on private loans are set by the lender"" so it was set to 11.75%.....are you goddamn fucking for real?  So you just get to set whatever fucking rate you want to?!  Man, I should go out and be a student loan broker....holy fucking shit.  So after I found this out I figured we would be able to call them and negotiate a lower principal buydown if we paid everything right now....as most collection agencies work.  NOPE!  No leniency, he needs to pay it in full either now or later....it doesn't matter we just need the full amount with all interest.

This is all part of the bigger problem.  Schools jack up their rates because they know any kid will get approved for an educational loan because, well fuck, the banks know ""we want the US to get more educated so we will approve anything and the federal loan process allows us to collect from them till the day they die so here, take $200K, we know we will get it back."".  It's a fucking self fulfilling prophecy that, for some reason, the feds back the banks making sure this albatross will be around their necks forever AND they can dictate what the interest rate will be?   

I get that I am illustrating the whole point some people believe why relieving student debt is a must but it's not the right way to do this.  Fix the systemic problem first otherwise it will continue down this path and help nobody.  People who were willing to take out a loan like this should still be responsible for the loan, they agreed to the more simple terms of knowing you were taking out a large amount money to pay for education.  If we want to look at rolling back the clock and putting a cap on the interest rate, that makes sense and I could get behind that but just throwing \~$1.25T at this problem seems frivolous.  I hear people on the very posts about canceling student debt talking about how they would, in turn, go buy a car and a house entering into another form of loan/debt.  If you were willing to enter into a student loan over your head to begin with I don't have a ton of faith those same people will go buy a house or car within their means and large defaults on loans absolutely does not stimulate the economy.  There just needs to be some sort of level of accountability from all levels; loanors, loanees and the educational instituation.

Sorry if this sounds like a rant, it kind of is but I wanted to justify my thoughts behind it and hear others thoughts as well.",2021-04-12 21:52:08

"How do you interact or engage with staunchly Conservative family members who are very vocal about their beliefs and have bought into far-right propaganda hook, line, and sinker?",42,mowivp,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/mowivp/how_do_you_interact_or_engage_with_staunchly/,50,1618195194.0,"Following the mass shooting in Boulder Colorado I had [an exchange](https://imgur.com/a/Kn6JoyW) with an Aunt and Uncle on Facebook about gun violence. *Click the link to read the full (name-blurred) facebook exchange on Imgur; It's a doozy.*

I tried to be respectful, honest, and factual in my responses, as well as leaving room for them to respond with their point of view. I thought I was giving them the opportunity to detail what they believed and why, but I instead received parroted responses of common far-right talking points with no indication that they took the time to read my responses.

I don't believe the phrase ""you can't reason with some people"" and genuinely what to know how others have handled similar situations. We are cordial enough when we meet in person; I also know them to be generous and good-hearted people. However, the only thing I see them use their facebook accounts for is to continuously share far-right memes that have become increasingly violent and bigoted. More than anything I'm sad that I seem to be losing family members to what I perceive to be a political cult.

I have the opportunity to see them this summer and I am on the fence whether to avoid the family gathering or to attend and pretend as if the exchange never happened. My family is what you would call ""mid-west nice"" and conflict avoidant, so I know my aunt and uncle won't bring it up while I'm there. I am already the black sheep of the family, so I don't really care if they bring it up while I'm not there to other family members, but it hurts me to see people I love live in a world of hate and lies.

I'd love to discuss this with anyone who is willing.

New bill in NC,5,mn8v3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/mn8v3y/new_bill_in_nc/,4,1617968762.0,"There’s a new bill that’s been proposed in North Carolina that wants to get rid of a trans person’s choice to go through treatment until they’re 21. 

It also creates several other issues that set terrible precedents for the state and possibly the country. Doctors are forced to report whenever people don’t conform with their traditional gender roles as well as deny them access to most forms of healthcare when possible.

This bill further cites that people should not be legally considered adults when it comes to medical decisions until they’re 21. 

This creates a really bad standard and I’m surprised to learn that more people aren’t talking about this further.",2021-04-09 07:46:02

"Lifelong Democrat, but I'm totally against abolishing the Filibuster. Hear me out:",0,mn5a3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/mn5a3f/lifelong_democrat_but_im_totally_against/,25,1617956223.0,"Hello friends. Like you (I presume), I voted for President Biden and he has made me proud with his character and his policies. I'm very-much in support of his national plans, and I'm behind the Democrats in Congress. 

However, this idea of abolishing the Filibuster is absolutely short-sighted and ultimately a bad idea. 

Right now, we (the Democratic party) have a government trifecta, and so the idea of streamlining policies seems like a great idea. We can get *so much accomplished* when we would otherwise just have more partisan gridlock. I recognize the upside to repealing it at this moment; don't think I don't. 

* **However** 

One thing is an absolute fact: the Republicans will regain the majority at some point in the future. To think that the Democrats are going to hold the majority in the senate for the rest of time is insanity. Majorities change. They've changed after Watergate, since Vietnam, since anything. Majorities never hold power in perpetuity. 

The Republicans (presumably later this decade/next decade when they get it together and become a classical party again) will one day hold the Senate majority. Do you not think Mitch Mcconnell is going to have an absolute field-day with this new 1-party power? Just consider it. If we repeal the Filibuster; the moment a Republican gets nominated as majority leader, this country's national policy will immediately shift far-to-mid-Right overnight with no way for a minority (us, in that case) to have our voices heard. 

TL;DR: I'm not saying the Democrats don't stand to gain enormously from the abolishment of the Senate filibuster, but we can't put that toothpaste back in the tube. We (this country) needs the ability for a minority to disrupt process. 

I too am frustrated with these Republican obstructionists, but we **must** hold onto this part of government. It is at our peril to convince ourselves *""well, we're the majority now so that means we always will be""*.",2021-04-09 04:17:03

NEW MEXICO DEMOCRATS!,0,mn475l,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/mn475l/new_mexico_democrats/,0,1617952707.0,"
From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico%27s_at-large_congressional_district):

&gt;New Mexico did *not* use congressional districts for its representatives to the United States House of Representatives from 1912 to 1969.

&gt;Instead, New Mexico elected its representatives statewide at-large [as a whole].

—————

From 1911–1968, a voter in New Mexico got to pick **three** US Congressmen, who get to vote on [national](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_People_Act) stuff.

In 2021, each voter in New Mexico gets to pick only **one** US Congressmen or Congresswomen... after 1964.

* The same folks who voted for *that* also voted against America’s 1964 Civil Rights Act, which **first** gave minorities and non-whites in New Mexico the right to voter

* The state changed districts virtually overnight after America passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act — which one of our *own* state’s senators voted *against*. 

* Every New Mexico’s voting power was divided by 1/3rd in 1968.

* New Mexico’s DNC is the majority now. We can undue what was *rushed* to do 70 years ago.

* Every New Mexican—white, black, brown—pays for the same stuff, but has **1/3rd** of the representation they had in 1964. Conversely, **2/3rds** of everyone’s vote in NM was stolen back in 1968

* Not to make things awkward for everyone but the folks who did it are only 55–77 years old today — and thought of us as inferior until 1964.

* (They don’t teach *that* at APS. I wonder why?)

———-

If *every* New Mexican’s vote was weakened in 1968 by conservatives dividing the state into three parts, couldn’t it be declared *retroactively* unconstitutional?

If they could do it, we can *definitely* “undue” it. We just need the numbers.",2021-04-09 03:18:27

I’m an RN and posted this to a Chauvin thread and got banned.,155,mlpv3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/mlpv3g/im_an_rn_and_posted_this_to_a_chauvin_thread_and/,113,1617783774.0,"I’m a nurse of a decade who had worked both in surgery and emergency. I have given fentanyl in high doses, multiple doses, for over 10 years.

Fentanyl is not an anesthetic (corrected: *primarily an anesthetic). It’s a narcotic pain medication. It can suppress your respiratory drive. Usually we give it in carefully monitored doses (usually in the post-surgery setting) but even then patients can be super sensitive to it. So if you give a patient fentanyl and they tell you they can’t breathe, you immediately check the airway, give oxygen. Administer narcan ASAP if it’s severe enough. I imagine as a first responder who regularly deals with people on this drug, they would know that too? 

Continuing to compress the airway of someone who is losing respiratory drive to fentanyl is 100% NOT what you do. Even if you don’t know what they are on and they tell you that they can’t breathe, you check/assess the patient like it’s real even if you think it’s BS. When I worked in the ED, we had patients all the time saying they were short of breathe or having chest pain and we always took them seriously even if we knew they were probably drug-seeking or just having a panic attack. You never wanna be the person that made the patient wait in the lobby with a chief complaint of shortness of breath that you thought was BS and it turned out to be real. For us, you for sure would get fired for that shit or lose your license. It might be criminal negligence.

Being on a prone (facedown) position already inhibits the lungs and diaphragm the room to expand properly and get air. Then also holding pressure to the neck for 9 mins? I mean, you can’t tell me someone couldn’t have checked a pulse right there? Wasn’t he handcuffed already? It’s really basic CPR. It’s in Basic Life Support (BLS) which I imagine police officers have to take every 2 years like medical professionals since they are first responders?

If he had cardiac arrest somewhere in that 9 mins, you can still potentially bring a patient back if you quickly give high quality CPR and continue to do so until medical help arrives. It’s literally what taking BLS every 2 years is supposed to teach a first responder.",2021-04-07 04:22:54

James Madison believed that the ease of communication in small republics was precisely what had allowed hastily formed majorities to oppress minorities. “Extend the sphere of a territory and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other.” Madison assumed that America’s vast geography and large population might stop dangerous factions from mobilizing. But they couldn't have possibly predicted social media and the rate at which disinformation, much of it foreign influenced, will spread.

Hamilton -The Federalist No 68- ""The desire \[of\] foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our counsels"" was a source of corruption and ""one of the most deadly adversaries of republican government.""

Adams shared that concern, discussing such he wrote to Jefferson ""As often as Elections happen the danger of foreign Influence recurs.""

""Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence ... the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government."" - Washington's farewell address.

In late 2019 Val Broeksmit acquired emails belonging to his father, former Deutsche Bank executive William S. Broeksmit who, like another Trump insider -Epstein, took his own life in 2014. Val presented these to the FBI. Shortly later in 2020 we out vis-à-vis Trump's recently released tax returns that he owes $400 million dollars to an undisclosed source. BUT now we know where he owes it.

Trump immediately, and unsuccessfully, tried to sue and silence Broeksmit who testified that the Russian State Bank was underwriting loans, PERSONAL and business, for Trump when Deutsche no longer would due to his previous defaulting on $640 million. Val presented many documents and it appears the Russian state bank had been signing off on Trump's personal loans for years. Putin signs off on loans from the Russian state bank.

Madison - ""Newfangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free government, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other.” For that reason, Madison continued, “the convention have, with great judgment, opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime.”

Definition: In Article III, Section 3 of the United States Constitution, treason is specifically limited to levying war against the US, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\[2\]

Penalty: U.S. Code Title 18: Death,\[8\] or not less than 5 years' imprisonment (minimum fine of $10,000, if not sentenced to death). Any person convicted of treason against the United States will lose the right to hold public office in the United States. \[9\]

The terms used in the definition derive from English legal tradition, specifically the Treason Act 1351. Levying war means --- the assembly of armed people to overthrow of the government or to resist its laws. --- Enemies are subjects of a foreign government that is in open hostility with the United States.\[10\] ----- Those who assemble to levy war, as well as those who conspire with them, can be prosecuted. ----- \[11\] The American definition is narrower than that of English law, which spanned other classes of treason such as counterfeiting and bringing indignity upon the king.\[12\]

Note from above -- Levying war means the assembly of armed people to overthrow of the government or to resist its laws. Those who assemble to levy war, as well as those who conspire with them can be prosecuted.

I personally think that owing hundreds of millions to an enemy nation, one that is openly hostile to the U.S, and has been sending unprecedented numbers bombers over the skies and off the shores of Alaska, makes him a little adherent. If you owed $400 million to a bank that you signed and Putin signed, would you say that's a little sticky?

Ron and Jim Watkins took over and just continued to spread lies and by the time the election rolls around in 2020 there's enough members to be a literal FACTION of the US. The group has become volatile and militant, they have been taught by Q that the democrats are evil enemies of the country, and Trump being full in on the thought heist repeats those claims. Trump, by claiming he doesn't know of Q, gives it legitimacy, Q must be telling the truth if he is saying the same things that Trump, the patriot, is saying. By that same association Q lends credibility to Trump because if you trust Q and Trump repeats his ""truths"", then Trump must be a good guy.

Madison, Federalist 10 - ""Among the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction.""  
\- ""By a faction I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.""

The Qanon Faction and right wing militant members/associates want a civil war based on misinformation that was pushed by a Russian asset and foreign ascendant. If Trump had really got the 1million in this first coup, as he requested, then we would no longer be a democratic constitutional republic. Trump will march again, and he's not doing it to MAGA.

Qanon and the MAGA faction have a couple traitorous generals, Michael Flynn and his brother, on their side as well. This is noteworthy because they retain some level of loyalty. His brother, the other Flynn, is the one responsible for delays in sending theNational Guard to help in Washington duiring the riot. Holding back troops, and giving the insurrectionists as much time as possible. He advised that having any guard assist would ""be bad optics.""

“In all very numerous assemblies, of whatever characters composed, passion never fails to wrest the sceptre from reason,” - The federalist #55.

Trump ambiguously gestures Qanon all the time. He wears a Q jersey, Q is the 17th letter. He does Q hand signals, he says Q instead of you, etc. The whole time lying and saying he doesn't know what the movement is. It was all part of a ploy to turn true patriots' love of country into a malignancy, and it worked.

Patriot is a pretty common word, but it's a code-word within Q that's used to address one another. So when Trump announced the march on DC, claiming that it was going to be the biggest most wild march ever, and then said he was calling all PATRIOTS, Trump knew he was calling out to those loyal to him within the violent faction that was waiting. After all they were told to ""sit back and stand by.""",2021-04-04 04:41:34

Even if you put the overt racism of the laws aside and just look at it from a numbers perspective.  They are alienating an entire block of voters whose numbers continue to rise year to year.  If you think about it there was some serious thought that went into it too, as they first had to have the Supreme Court overturn the Voting Rights Act.  Then zoom out and focus back in on young people.  This demographic has grown up with nothing but mass shootings, and school shooter drills.  The one time the kids rise up and demand common sense gun laws and the Republican held government loses their spine and refuses to do anything.  Add to that the incessant pandering to a white religious minority.

"I had an idea on how to reform the filibuster, without reforming the filibuster.",10,mi9m6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/mi9m6p/i_had_an_idea_on_how_to_reform_the_filibuster/,4,1617354506.0,"What if, instead of amending the filibuster, we write a new talking filibuster rule?

Let me explain:

If we write a new rule, and it gets passed, it becomes part of the senate rules. 

Because of that, instead of using the nuclear option to just override Rule 22 and end legislation with a simple majority, which some senators don’t support, we can use it to override rule 22, citing that this new rule says that 41% of the senate must be on the floor for debate to continue. 

This way, we don’t have to amend Rule 22, which requires a supermajority, and it technically follows the rules, so the presiding officer of the senate can’t technically veto it. 

What do you think?

Also btw, I’m 15, so I’m sorry if this is stupid.

Edit: I wrote a draft rule for this bc I was bored. You can find it [here. ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MbyUUjDOTSXr_kaf9JWMwCMyQpmVF-34Y1fe0DyLN_w/edit)",2021-04-02 05:08:26

[Personal Opinion] The “remove the filibuster” is a double edged sword,5,mhnd39,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/mhnd39/personal_opinion_the_remove_the_filibuster_is_a/,12,1617279347.0,"Hello,

I am a younger person who recently has gotten serious about how our country is headed and how it’s going. Let’s jump right into why I think the filibuster’s (potential) removal can be a very damaging thing.

Scenario 1, good ending 

Democrats use reconciliation to pass HR1 or similar methods. This creates the ideal voting scenario and the Democrats break the tradition of the sitting presidents party losing votes and Dems gain more seats in both house and senate and become a filibuster proof majority. Democrats remove the filibuster and are able to pass laws freely and serve the American people without GOP curb stomping any bill like they are today.

Scenario 1.1, alternative good ending 

Democrats use some weird political trickery (Joe Manchin support?) to bypass the filibuster essentially and pass the much needed filibuster-required bills we have. The rest of the scenario plays out like the original.

———————

Scenario 2, the “double edged” bad ending 

This scenario plays out almost identical to scenario 1 and can be used in scenario 1.1. The bad ending comes up in 2024 where in this scenario a red wave comes and takes the House, barely takes Senate, and Presidency. Without a filibuster the GOP goes **scorched earth** and runs rampant and carves a path to never let anyone else win again.*

Hope you enjoyed my little “war games” thoughts, sorry if anything is completely unrealistic or crazy. I’m new to politics and this has been on my mind lately and I wanted to share!

In the late 1970s, Matt Gaetz's father co-founded a nonprofit hospice company, Vitas which they sold in 2004, In 2013, the Justice Department sued Vitas, alleging that between 2002 and 2013, the company had defrauded Medicare by filing false claims for services never provided or for patients who weren’t terminally ill. The company settled the case in 2017 for more than $75 million, at the time the largest settlement ever recovered from a hospice company. 

House Speaker Ray Sansom, a friend of Don Gaetz for whom Matt had worked as a legislative aide during law school. In April 2009, Sansom was indicted on corruption charges, accused of tweaking the state budget to funnel more than $25 million to Northwest Florida State College in Niceville. Of those funds, $6 million was earmarked to build a hangar at the Destin airport for a jet company owned by one of Sansom’s friends and donors, real estate developer Jay Odom. Odom was also a client of Matt Gaetz, who handled Odom’s hangar lease. (In 2013, Odom would be sentenced to six months in prison for illegally funneling $23,000 into former Arkansas Gov.

It would have been illegal for Don Gaetz to lend six figures to the campaign, but he appears to have found another way to funnel money to his son’s race.Matt Gaetz sold a house he owned for just under $100,000. Three months later, he sold several vacant lots he’d bought years earlier. All of Gaetz’s real estate was purchased by the same buyer: a company called Treveron, which, it turns out, is owned by his dad. 

When Trump called Haiti a “shithole” country in January 2018, Gaetz took to the airwaves to concur that Haiti was “deplorable,” full of “sheet metal and garbage.---orlandoweekly

Could the Georgia voting law be struck down as unconstitutional?,58,meembp,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/meembp/could_the_georgia_voting_law_be_struck_down_as/,23,1616883365.0,"First, there's the most obviously bullshit provision of this law: Criminalizing the handing out of food and water to those waiting in line to vote. That doesn't even have any rational connection to the pretextual excuse of safeguarding against fraudulent votes. So I wonder if that part of the law could even pass rational basis review, let alone any scrutiny higher than that.

But then there are the other parts of the law, the parts that at least purport on their face to be aimed at detecting and stopping election fraud. While that may be the pretextual excuse, anyone with half a brain can tell that this is just being passed by a Republican-trifecta state in order to keep the democrats out of power. It's clearly just designed to make it logistically impossible for black citizens to vote in large enough numbers that the democrats can pose a threat.

Now, do we have any *proof* (that is to say ... evidence that will hold up in court, not just our common sense as we read the news) that the Georgia Republicans are purposefully and maliciously targeting black voters (as opposed to Democrat voters)? Probably not. However, is it really necessary for us to show said proof? I would argue that, if an election law even so much as has the *disparate impact* of discriminating against black citizens, that alone means it violates the 15th Amendment to the US Constitution.

That's how it works with employment discrimination. For example, in many federal appellate circuits, it is illegal to discriminate against an applicant for employment solely on the basis of their criminal record, because courts have recognized that such a policy has the disparate impact of disproportionately affecting black people, even though the words ""disparate impact"" never appear in the text of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If the words ""disparate impact"" don't appear in the Civil Rights Act but it's still the force of law nonetheless, I see no reason why the same logic can't also be used to incorporate a ""disparate impact"" provision into the 15th Amendment.

So what do you guys think? Will this law likely be struck down as unconstitutional?",2021-03-27 18:16:05

Am I *really* a Democrat...can you help me?,2,me3i6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/me3i6q/am_i_really_a_democratcan_you_help_me/,12,1616837062.0,"I apologize if this isn't the correct sub, and if this is too long or considered a rant. Please feel free to redirect me if this isn't the place to post.

So here goes. I'm a guy in my early 20s who lives in a very red ""Rust Belt"" state in the Midwest. And I would say I've had a very typical childhood experience for someone from here, including political and religious background: I was raised in a pretty socially and religious conservative household. While I have some memories about government from early childhood (like vaguely Bush as President), politics became a much bigger focus of my life with the 2008 election. The actions, cultural issues, and policies of the Obama administration were the center of frequent conversation in my house. They were ""bad"" and ""ruining America"" (in my family's opinion), and being a kid, I mostly accepted this framework and worldview up until my teenage years.

As a young teenager, I began to express disagreement with some of my parents' religious and political views (especially on social issues, which led to shouting more than once). It resulted in frequent arguments, and after a few years of this (in addition to continued exposure to almost exclusively conservative political commentary), I eventually stopped talking about my views. Over the next couple of years (mid to late teens), I feel like I tried to form to ""fit the mold"" of some of my family's political beliefs again. I mostly took in conservative commentary and media through big YouTube boom of more culturally ascendant conservative commentators on the right, which really took off just before the 2016 election.

To make a long story hopefully less long, I voted for Trump (and Republicans down ballot) in 2016 (my first election where I could vote) and 2020. But there were considerations that bothered me privately. Everything from personal conduct, mannerisms, some policies, to the ""fly by the seat of your pants"" attitude of the former administration. And the actions and rhetoric of Republicans at large recently has bothered me too: the hand waving away of investigation relating to the Capitol on January 6th, the unwillingness to be compromising, the attempt to lower trust in America's voting process, the obsession with culture war issues, and even the recent attempts to whittle away at voter's rights. It's frankly frightening.

And recently I feel like I've been lying to myself about my worldview and stances on political issues for a long time. So I've been making an attempt to be more honest with myself and others about my opinions when conversations happen. And I feel embarrassed that I've allowed myself to vote for certain people. But I want to be more educated and go into every election without so much partisan bias without considering what's really for the best of our country. In a lot of ways, I can't consider myself a Republican.

I'm not even entirely sure what I'm asking. I guess do you think I might be a Democrat? Or has anyone here been or is in my position? Or how can I properly educate myself more to figure this out?


**TL;DR: Grew up in a ""Republican"" environment, believed and voted that way since 2016. I don't align with Republicans in a lot of ways if I'm honest with myself, am I really a Democrat?**",2021-03-27 05:24:22

My question is, why free college instead of improving high school education?

I continue with why he was ""hired"" (elected)  for the term, when if someone was hiring a janitor,  they would check their experience  to see if a broom fit in their hand! But Norco, the ""followers"" are tired of career politicians,  so let's go with someone with a resume of bankruptcy,  marital affairs, lawsuits, and a daddy who payed his way.

They then feel the need to say something about our President,  like, he is going to ban red meat! I ask them where they heard that , and here comes Fox news.  They will throw back he is tearing down the fence, letting all the rapists and murderers in. Then I correct what they are claiming.

If they are going to bitch about our President, at least have a reason. Don't  just dislike him because he isn't  the other guy. Know your facts before you gripe, and be prepare to explain them.

Some quick background. In a 2008 case called District of Columbia v. Heller, the court’s “originalist” conservatives took the text of the Second Amendment and essentially crossed out everything up to and including “free State,” ruling for the first time that the right to bear arms has nothing to do with well-regulated militias

The 1934 Mid-Term Elections And Why They Are Relevant,10,n05l2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/n05l2u/the_1934_midterm_elections_and_why_they_are/,2,1619608267.0,"The ""common wisdom"" is that the President's party loses seats in the mid-terms. I think this claim is obsolete in the Trump Era. I predict that President Biden's party will gain seats because of his popularity.

Of course, if you are a Democrat, you already know that Franklin Roosevelt was elected in 1932 and took office in 1933. So you already know that the 1934 mid-terms was a referendum on FDR's first 100 days and first year in office. What you probably don't know is the results.

 From Wiki:

The Democrats built on the Congressional majorities they had won in the previous two elections. In the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives), Roosevelt's party gained nine seats, mostly from the [Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)). The Democrats also gained nine seats in the [U.S. Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate), thereby winning a supermajority. A [Progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Progressive_Party) also unseated a Republican in the Senate. This marked the first time since the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) that an incumbent president's party gained seats in a midterm election, followed by [1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_1998) and [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_2002).

The election was perhaps the most successful midterm of the 20th century for the party in control of the presidency.

That being said, I also respect the Senate's role as a deliberative body and as a check on the more unhinged populism of the House of Representatives.

I'm concerned about the GOP using a simple majority next time they're in power to do some really destructive things.  Thus I'm not certain that nuking the filibuster outright would be the best approach.  However, even if we were to bend the rules to allow the bill's passage, I still believe that GOP would use this as justification to circumvent the filibuster anyway, since they're in general way more vindictive and dishonest/shameless than Democrats.

What is the strategy, if any, right now within the Senate majority caucus?  I have called both of my Senators to tell them how important I believe SB1 to be, but where we go from here seems strategically treacherous.",2021-04-26 16:55:15

Repeal the Gay Blood Ban,20,my15pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/my15pf/repeal_the_gay_blood_ban/,1,1619355186.0,"The Gay Blood Ban is now technically only a 3-month, and until recently 12-month, ""deferral"" (though conservative elements at the FDA and Red Cross fought that one tooth and nail...  Not surprising: in my own personal experience training/volunteering with them in the Midwest, the Red Cross is still full of homophobes in many parts of the country...) but is still effectively a ban on any sexually-active gay man, or bisexual man currently in a same-sex relationship, from giving blood.

This article discusses it:

https://georgetownvoice.com/2021/04/17/gay-men-cant-donate-blood/

This ban, because that's what it really is, needs to stop.  It must end.

As hospitals cried out desperately for blood during the height of this pandemic, it was extremely discouraging knowing, for instance, that as I tried to drag my homophobic father by the ear to give blood with me, I (a only partly out-of-closet bisexual: my father doesn't know) could face some very awkward conversations with a homophobic Red Cross nurse that might risk alerting my nosy father, if I tried to give...  (as it happens I hadn't had any sexual contact with ANYONE in the 3 months before that, and my last sexual relationship had been with a woman anyways: in fact I've been largely abstinent my entire life both due to my own religious reasons/concerns with too much premarital or homosexual sex, and due to having incredible difficulty being accepted in dating...)

This ban coats lives.  It discourages people from giving when there is absolutely no reason for it.  In fact, that liason with a woman I hadn't known long (from internet dating, and SHE was the one who got things sexual by the way) and could have carried any of numerous STD's (condoms were used, but can break or slip...) was inarguably a LOT riskier than a homosexual married couple who had been in an exclusive relationship 20 years would be...

The fact I could've donated the day after screwing a random girl from Tinder who I barely knew, if I wanted, but a committed homosexusl couple would be barred from donating blood for 3 ENTIRE MONTHS after having sex (which, let's face it, no real couple is going to go that long without... so it's effectively a ban) is absolutely incorrigible.

Biden is in office.  Moderate Democrats CLAIM to want to save lives in this pandemic- and the next one.

And a blood shortage costs lives every day (I would know: I'm a biologist and a pre-med, taking my 2nd and 3rd Master's at a Med School- I have shadowed doctors, worked EMS, and have a LOT of academic and incidental exposure to the medical system).  So why don't we get this fixed?",2021-04-25 08:53:06

A message long forgotten,4,mur8bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/mur8bq/a_message_long_forgotten/,3,1618956785.0,"Crucially, Socrates was not elitist in the normal sense. He didn’t believe that a narrow few should only ever vote. He did, however, insist that only those who had thought about issues rationally and deeply should be let near a vote. 

We have forgotten this distinction between an intellectual democracy and a democracy by birthright. We have given the vote to all without connecting it to that of wisdom. 

And Socrates knew exactly where that would lead: to a system the Greeks feared above all, demagoguery. dēmos ‘the people’ + agōgos ‘leading Ancient Athens had painful experience of demagogues, for example, the louche figure of Alcibiades, a rich, charismatic, smooth-talking wealthy man who eroded basic freedoms and helped to push Athens to its disastrous military adventures in Sicily. 

Socrates knew how easily people seeking election could exploit our desire for easy answers. He asked us to imagine an election debate between two candidates, one who was like a doctor and the other who was like a sweet shop owner. 

The sweet shop owner would say of his rival: *Look, this person here has worked many evils on you. He hurts you, gives you bitter potions and tells you not to eat and drink whatever you like. He’ll never serve you feasts of many and varied pleasant things like I will.*

Socrates asks us to consider the audience response: Do you think the doctor would be able to reply effectively? The true answer – ‘I cause you trouble, and go against you desires in order to help you’ would cause an uproar among the voters, don’t you think? 

We have forgotten all about Socrates’s salient warnings against democracy. We have preferred to think of democracy as an unambiguous good – rather than a process that is only ever as effective as the education system that surrounds it. **As a result, we have elected many sweet shop owners, and very few doctors**",2021-04-20 18:13:05

It really didn't make sense for Republicans to oppose it because their own constituents would be directly benefitting from it. The main excuse used over and again was that it wasn't covid relief. Which now looking at the infrastructure package, you can tell will the excuse Republicans will use for everything Biden wants to pass. They'll claim it's not whatever Biden claims it is.

Anyways, do you really think the Republicans actually think the Covid relief package wasn't really covid relief? Or do you think they don't want to be seen as helping Biden push his agenda? Any Republican who would have voted for the relief would have most likely gotten plenty of attention in the media. It wouldn't have been a bad thing to do to vote for it. But there's a good chance they didn't want to be known to their Republican peers as the person helping Biden succeed. What doy you guys think?",2021-04-19 10:36:06

It is the dems doing what is correct and for the good of the country.

The ''republicans'' are only going along with it since they do not have the numbers to stop it.

If you do not believe me think about this, if the ''republicans'' were the ones with the power would they be doing any of this or would they kill it all.

No, they would not give two shits about any of it.

Right wing indoctrination,3,mr7d1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/mr7d1d/right_wing_indoctrination/,20,1618488971.0,"This may be an unconventional post but I think its needed. Recently I've been delving deep into right ideologies and as a result conspiracy theories/false information. I'm beginning to believe and have doubts about COIVD-19, the vaccine, and the current state of the government. I'm looking for the voice of reason here. I don't want to indoctrinate myself and need some fact checking, logical reasoning, and persuasion back to a realistic perspective of our country. 

Here are major points of correction: 

\- The contents of the COVID vaccine; can we trust that the vaccine is safe? Does it contain harmful substances? The government is pushing the vaccine hard, can we trust what they say or is this another case of lobbying and/or government/corporate propaganda? Are the ""jacking"" the vaccine, adding additional ingredients they aren't telling us? It comes down to this; is the vaccine safe to take?

\- Coronavirus has a >\~2% fatality rate, is it really worth it to shut down the economy? The economic impact of COVID is costing many jobs, how are people supposed to pay for rent, food, utilities? Even with stimulus from the government people are still struggling. Is this just a plot against the people?

I'm looking for facts, not a right wing eco chamber to indorenate me further. Can I trust government sentiment? In our modern world there is an influx of information and its hard to tell what's true and what's false. Please correct the misinformation that has plagued me, I need a realist view of our current government. 

\*This is not trolling. I am not looking to debate. I am looking for factually correct information that will give me a realistic view of our country.\*

Thanks in advance for the help/advice!",2021-04-15 08:16:11
